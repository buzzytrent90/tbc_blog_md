### Revit API Wishlist Survey

Once again, the time has come for another round of API wishlist surveys.

#### Revit 2015 Add-In Manager

Before getting into the details of that, let me mention
[Augusto Gonçalves](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/augusto-goncalves.html)'s
useful note on the modified installation procedure for the
[Revit 2015 Add-In Manager](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2014/05/revit-2015-add-in-manager.html) included
in the May 14
[Revit 2015 SDK Update Release 2](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/updated-sdk-devtv-bim-360-news-and-viewer.html#2),
which now just provides the .dll and .addin files, no longer any MSI installer.

#### The Spring 2014 Revit API Wishlist Survey

This year's
