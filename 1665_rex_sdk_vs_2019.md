### REX SDK Templates for Revit Structure 2019
Apparently, the Revit SDK REX Visual Studio templates are obsolete.
Let's fix that problem.
Also, two little notes on a C# optimisation trick for math-heavy code, and the current status of the Forge Design Automation API for Revit:
- [Revit Structure 2019 REX Extension SDK Visual Studio Templates](#2)
- [Improve C# Performance Using Struct Instead of Class](#3)
- [Update on the Forge Design Automation API for Revit](#4)

#### Revit Structure 2019 REX Extension SDK Visual Studio Templates
Apparently, the Visual Studio templates provided with the REX SDK to make use of the Revit Structure Extensions have not yet been updated for Revit 2019.
This came up in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on an [Issue with SDK and Visual Studio](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/issue-with-sdk-and-visual-studio/m-p/8070414).
I now heard back from the development team on this, and they sent
an [updated set of REX SDK Visual Studio templates for Revit Structure 2019](zip/REX_SDK_Visual_Studio_templates_2019.zip).
I hope this solves the issue.
#### Improve C# Performance Using Struct Instead of Class
A useful piece of C# optimisation advice: in math-heavy code, use `struct` instead of `class` to bunch small chunks of data.
This suggestion and the detailed explanation is provided by Aras Pranckevičius in
his [daily pathtracer article part 3: C# & Unity & Burst](http://aras-p.info/blog/2018/03/28/Daily-Pathtracer-Part-3-CSharp-Unity-Burst.).
#### Update on the Forge Design Automation API for Revit
Bruno [@in4matikerCH](https://twitter.com/in4matikerCH) Grutsch reacted to yesterday's post
on [what the Forge APIs do](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/06/forge-for-aec-and-bim360-overview.html#3)
and [asks](https://twitter.com/in4matikerCH/status/1007506246134624256):
\*\*Question:\*\* Do you have information when the Forge Design Automation API for Revit, i.e. online access to Revit API functionality – aka Revit I/O – will be publicly available? What will be possible compared to today?
\*\*Answer:\*\* Yes, I will happily answer. However, that would merit an entire blog post of its own.
The Forge Design Automation API for Revit is currently in a very limited private beta.
Your question is asked regularly in the private beta forum as well.
Last time it was raised, no answer could yet be provided.
