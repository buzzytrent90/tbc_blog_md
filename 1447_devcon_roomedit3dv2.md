### Freeing Your BIM Data and Roomedit3d Forge OAuth
The [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) took off yesterday with a big bang, as you have certainly heard by now.
The [3D Web Fest](http://www.3dwebfest.com) evening event was also very cool.
My favourite was [Particle Love](http://edankwan.com/experiments/particle-love)
by [Edan Kwan](http://edankwan.com).
Today is the big day for me, with my presentation
on [Freeing your BIM Data](http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/#track-4) coming up this afternoon.
Here are all the roomedit3dv2 resources for you to explore at your own leisure:
- [Detailed discussion](http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/06/forge-platform-and-roomedit3d-with-thee-legged-oauth.html)
- [Slide deck](zip/free_your_bim_data.pdf)
- [Demo recording](https://youtu.be/bDI5YX7PDP8) ([download](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/roomedit3dv2.mp4))

To wrap up, here are a couple of snapshots of Fort Mason and DevCon day one that I took yesterday:
