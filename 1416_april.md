### Swami Ma Anand Mazaak Buddhoo
My [Vipassana meditation retreat](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/03/vipassana-meditation-and-idling-versus-external-events.html) is
nearing its end...
I have had a wonderful time with peace, quiet, introspection...
I am very glad to already now announce one radical decision I have taken:
I am being ordinated as a monk!
![Monk ordination](img/monk_ordination.jpg)
The blog format will be modified to include some spiritual messages, silent passages for meditation, and chimes.
The new name will be announced next week.
I am looking forward to my return to the so-called 'normal' life, all the changes my decision will bring, and diving back into the Revit API from a more spiritual point of view.
I will be very honoured if you would like to address me henceforth as

Swami Ma Anand

May all sentient beings be happy!
