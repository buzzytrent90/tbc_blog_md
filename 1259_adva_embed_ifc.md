### Embedding an Interactive View and Data IFC Model

Here is an interactive 3D sample embedding of an IFC file uploaded to A360 to answer a question in this morning's DevDays conference here in Munich:

Click to navigate, rotate, pan and zoom as you like.

I was prompted to upload and test the IFC file format translation by Adam Nagy, sitting together in the back row, after taking neat pictures of

Here are some other samples of developers experimenting with similar things in the past few days:
