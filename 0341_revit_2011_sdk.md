### Public Revit 2011 SDK Posting

The Revit 2011 SDK is now available on the public
[Revit Developer Center](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit) site.

Here are some of the last-minute changes documented between the beta version and this one:

##### Refactored Document properties related to transactions

Two existing properties have been re-implemented to better complement the changes in the transaction framework:

- Document.IsReadOnly indicates that a document is in read-only state, either temporarily or permanently.
  If it is read-only, new transactions may not be started in that document, and thus the model cannot be modified.- Document.IsModifiable indicates whether a document is currently modifiable or not.
    A document is not modifiable if either there is no transaction currently open or due to some temporary state lock modification for a certain operation.
    Taken from another perspective, a transaction may be started only when document is not yet modifiable, and is also not read-only.

##### FamilyHostingBehavior

The FamilyHostingBehavior enumeration represents the type of host a family expects. The value for a particular family can be obtained from the familys built-in parameter FAMILY\_HOSTING\_BEHAVIOR.

##### FamilyInstance.Host property improved

The FamilyInstance.Host property will now return the host element of faced-hosted family instances. Previously it returned null.
