### TransTips ADN Plugin of the Month

Another ADN Plugin of the Month has been released, this time for all four products AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit and 3ds Max:
The September
[ADN Plugin of the Month](http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins) on
Autodesk Labs is the
[TransTips tooltip translation utility](http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins) that
[we already discussed here](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/translate-revit-tooltips.html) and
of which
[Kean published a preview](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/08/translating-tooltips-in-autocad-inventor-revit-and-3ds-max-using-net.html).

In brief, TransTips uses a web service to translate tooltips into one of 36 languages on the fly.
While sometimes imperfect, automatic translations can make the products usable when no appropriate local language version is available.
Some of the countries not addressed by the current localized product offerings are among the fastest growing economies in the world.

Here you can see the tool in action:

TransTips stores a local, editable cache of the translations it obtains, allowing you to edit and deploy them to customers along with the plugin.
Having a complete cache also removes the need for an Internet connection for the plugin to work.

And as always, as a Plugin of the Month, the full source code for TransTips is provided as part of the Labs download, allowing you to tailor and extend the functionality for your specific needs.
