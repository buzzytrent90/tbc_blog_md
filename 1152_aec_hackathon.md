### AEC Hackathon, DevGuide URL and AppStore Webinar

As mentioned, I registered for the upcoming
[AEC Symposium and Hackathon](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/no-devcamp-better-ny-aec-technology-symposium.html) in
New York this coming weekend, May 16-18.

You can learn more about both at
<http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014>,
and especially check out the
[interesting projects](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/aec-technology-hackathon-2014/hacks) proposed
for the AEC Hackathon.

I'm looking forward very much to that and would be happy to meet you there!

#### Revit API Developer Guide Shortcut URL

The Revit API Developer Guide shortcut URL has changed and is now
[www.autodesk.com/revitapi-help](http://www.autodesk.com/revitapi-help).

To my utter shock and chagrin, the previous one –
[www.autodesk.com/revitapi-wikihelp](http://www.autodesk.com/revitapi-wikihelp) –
has "expired" and no longer works.

Very sorry about that, out of my hands!

I have fixed the old blog posts using that URL:

- [Wiki API Help, View Event and Structural Material Type](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/wiki-api-help-view-event-and-structural-material-type.html)
- [Revit API Developer Guide on Autodesk WikiHelp](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/revit-api-developer-guide-on-autodesk-wikihelp.html)
- [The Champions Roundtable at AU](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/the-champions-roundtable-at-au.html)
- [On Handling Warnings and Failures](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/on-handling-warnings-and-failures.html)

I wonder who else in the world will do the same?
