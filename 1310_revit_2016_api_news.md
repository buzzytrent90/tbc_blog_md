### Revit 2016 API News and DevDays Online Recording

Revit 2016 has been released!

Let's dive straight in to the new Revit API functionality, plus a note on table of contents for video recordings:

#### Revit 2016 API News – DevDays Online Slide Deck, Recording, Notes and Sample Code

Here is the Revit 2016 DevDays Online recording material, based on the presentations shown at the confidential Autodesk DevDays conferences held towards the end of last year and the beginning of this.

Most of the samples are implemented as macros embedded in the RVT models.

#### Video Recording Table of Contents

A table of contents or [TOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents) is a useful feature for any video recording that lasts for longer than a couple of minutes.

Happily, if your recording includes any interaction with PowerPoint, Camtasia can automatically generate a TOC for you from all the PowerPoint slide titles.

In addition to the pure video recording file, e.g. in MP4 or some other equivalent format, Camtasia creates HTML and JavaScript wrapper files to display and navigate through the TOC in the browser.
Therefore, in Camtasia, you have to 'export to web', not just generate the MP4.

I used that feature in several recordings presented here previously as well, e.g. the
[recording](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/devday/2013/online/Revit_2015_API_News/index.html) from
last year's [Revit 2015 API overview](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2015-api.html).

The longer the recording, the more useful this becomes, of course.

Unfortunately, Typepad balked at my attempts to upload the 642-MB MP4 file for this year's recording.

Therefore, at the moment, I can only offer it to you as a TOC-less
[33-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fo55QTwBdBM):

I'll update this post to include a recording with an associated table of contents as soon as Typepad gets the ticket I submitted to upload my MP4 fixed.

#### RevitLookup for Revit 2016

RevitLookup is one of the most important tools to understand and explore the Revit database, its elements, their properties and relationships.

It was originally included in the Revit SDK and then moved to its own
[RevitLookup GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) to
facilitate community support and easy addition of enhancements.

The first version for Revit 2016 has now been published.

The current version is
[release 2016.0.0.6](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2016.0.0.6).

Please help yourself!

If you have already made enhancements to your own version that you would like to share, or notice anything missing in the current version, please fork the repository, add your changes, and submit a pull request for me to integrate them back into the main stream.

Thank you!

I wish you lots of fun exploring the exciting new possibilities provided by the Revit 2016 API!
