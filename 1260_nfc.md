### Milano Meetups and My New NFC Business Card

We completed the DevDays conference and Meetup in Munich and now arrived in Milano, bella Italia.

Tonight we are holding our
[Inaugural 3D Lovers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/I-love3Dmilano/events/214758572) here at
[Coworking LOGIN](http://www.coworkinglogin.it),
[Via Stefanardo da Vimercate 28, Milano](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Via+Stefanardo+da+Vimercate+28%2C+Milano%2C+MI%2C+it).

We only just noticed that another interesting inaugural meetup is taking place in the same location at the same time, the
[First MEAN Event: Break the Ice](http://www.meetup.com/MM-MeanMilan/events/218926426).

[MEAN](http://mean.io) stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js, so you can see how well it fits.

Main topic for today: new functionality of
[ECMAScript 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript),
the base for the next release of JavaScript et al, scheduled for release in the middle of 2015.

Here is the [slide deck](http://linkme.it/MM/es6/#/2/4).

#### My New Near Field Communication Business Card

We have been handing out Google cardboard boxes at our meetup events.

Each box includes an
[NFC](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) card.
Simply hold it against the back of your NFC-enabled phone and it will take you straight to the [Dodocase](http://www.dodocase.com) web site.

You can easily reprogram it to take you to any other URL you like, in just 60 seconds, e.g. using the free
[Tagstand NFC Writer](http://www.tagstand.com).
There are lots of other free NFC write apps in the mobile stores as well.

I grabbed a card and set it up to link to

The Building Coder.

No more paper business cards for me, just a few electrons.

Sustainable.

And cool   :-)

#### Cloud Accelerator Workshop Web Site Live

Talking about cool web oriented technology, the
[Autodesk Cloud Accelerator web site](http://www.autodeskcloudaccelerator.com) is
now live – I already mentioned the
[cloud accelerator workshop invitation](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/cloud-accelerator-vdc-and-transaction-groups.html#2) a
couple of weeks ago.
