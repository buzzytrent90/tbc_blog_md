### API Wish List Survey Reminder

This year's
[Revit API wish list survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22ALQSSG7LZ)
that I
[recently pointed out](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/api-wishlist-survey.html)
was initially scheduled to close today.

Kean just informed us of the
[current progress and a prolongation](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/05/theres-still-time-to-fill-out-the-2010-api-wishlist-surveys.html) until **June 11th, 2010**.

Please take the time to fill it out, if you have not already done so.
Thank you!
