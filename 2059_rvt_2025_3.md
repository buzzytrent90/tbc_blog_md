### AU API Wishes and Revit 2025.3
AU is over and Revit 2025.3 has been released:
- [Revit 2025.3](#2)
- [Revit 2025.3 SDK](#3)
- [Boost Your BIM AU API wishes](#4)
- [Claude computer use does stuff](#5)
#### Revit 2025.3
Revit 2025.3 has been released.
An overview of the new features is provided by The Factory
in [What’s new and improved in Revit 2025.3](https://www.autodesk.com/blogs/aec/2024/10/15/autodesk-revit-2025-3/).
Highlights at a glance:
- Productivity enhancements for documentation production
- Performance and user experience improvements, including your UI readability feedback
- Export ceiling grids to IFC
- Modernized UI for load cases and combinations
- Rebar group sets when exporting to IFC
- Duplicate layers for system families
- Add-in manager
- Background PDF export initialization dialog
- In-context spell check
- New updates for Autodesk Insight, including direct data exchange for more automation in AIA2030 reporting
- Recentre room reference lines and room tags
Of special interest to users and developers alike, the updated Add-In Manager enables you to identify all installed add-ins for each version of Revit, simply enable or disable individual add-ins before opening Revit and provides more visibility on critical insights like the load time of each add-in so that you can make easy and informed decisions about which add-ins may be reducing the time for you to get to work in Revit:

#### Revit 2025.3 SDK
The Revit SDK has been updated for Revit 2025.3, and the new version is available from
the [Revit developer page](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/revit).
I compared the Revit 2025 SDK with the new version and created [a list of differing files](doc/2025_3_file_diff.txt).
Note the following new files:
- ./Samples/AnalysisVisualizationFramework/DistanceToSurfaces/CS/
- Command.cs
- DistanceToSurfaces.addin
- DistanceToSurfaces.csproj
- ReadMe_DistanceToSurfaces.rtf
- ./Samples/ExternalResourceServer/ExternalResourceDBServer/CS/
- ServerInterfaceExtensionsForRevitLinks.cs
- ./Samples/Massing/DividedSurfaceByIntersects/CS/
- Command.cs
- DividedSurfaceByIntersects.addin
- DividedSurfaceByIntersects.csproj
- Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs
- ReadMe_DividedSurfaceByIntersects.rtf
- ./Structural Analysis SDK/Examples/Concrete/CodeCheckingConcreteExample/
- Concrete/InternalForcesSurface.cs
- Main/Calculation/SurfaceSection.cs
- Main/ResultSurfaceElement.cs
- Server/ServerResultsSurface.cs
- Utility/ResultInPointSurface.cs
So, we seem to have gained a new external command or two and some other enhancements.
#### Boost Your BIM AU API Wishes
Once again,
Harry Mattison of [Boost Your BIM](https://x.com/BoostYourBIM) fulfilled
several AU API wishes that you might want to check out:
1. [Turn off annotations for all links in a view](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/au2024-revit-api-wish-1/)
2. [Select objects by picking subcategory](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/au2024-wish-2/)
Many thanks to Harry for sharing these and once again proving that a lot can be achieved with the Revit API.
#### Claude Computer Use Does Stuff
Anthropic announced
[computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use).
To understand what this can mean, watch the two-minute video
on [Claude computer use for automating operations](https://youtu.be/ODaHJzOyVCQ):

It is already generating quite a stir in social media and
the [Internet in general](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=claude+computer+use).
For more details, check out the Claude documentation
on [computer use (beta)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use).
