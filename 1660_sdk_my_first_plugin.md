### Revit 2019 SDK and My First Plugin Update
Slowly but surely and one by one, the Revit 2019 updates are percolating through to
the [Revit Developer Centre](http://autodesk.com/developrevit):
- [Revit 2019 SDK published](#2)
- [My First Revit Plugin update](#3)
#### Revit 2019 SDK Published
The Revit 2019 SDK has now been properly and completely published.
I pointed out
the [direct `REVIT_2019_SDK.msi` download link](http://download.autodesk.com/us/revit-sdk/REVIT_2019_SDK.msi) for the SDK when
describing [installing the Revit 2019 SDK April update](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/05/installing-the-revit-2019-sdk-april-update.html)
Now it also appears in its proper location in
the [Revit Developer Centre](http://autodesk.com/developrevit)
at [autodesk.com/developrevit](http://autodesk.com/developrevit),
which nowadays points to a new location
at [www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit).

#### My First Revit Plugin Update
Another important update for getting started with the Revit API is
the [My First Revit Plug-In tutorial](http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin)
at [www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin](http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin).
> It is a self-paced tutorial guide for a smooth introduction into the programming world. This is a 'one-stop shop' learning path for users who know Revit but are new to programming and thinking about taking the plunge. It introduces the Revit .NET API using the C# programming language.
The accompanying [one-hour-43-minute video introduction](https://youtu.be/q3x-rne4aLw) is still unchanged, though:
