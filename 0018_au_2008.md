### AU 2008

I am very much looking forward
[Autodesk University 2008](http://au.autodesk.com/event)
in December in Las Vegas, where I will be presenting classes on some Revit API topics:

- [DE101-3 The Revit SDK Sample Smrgsbord](http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/?speaker=Jeremy+Tammik&year=2008) (Tue. 12/2 8:15 am - 9:45 am)

- [DE301-2 The Ins and Outs of Revit MEP Programming](http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/?speaker=Jeremy+Tammik&year=2008) (Thu. 12/4 8:15 am - 9:45 am)

I'll also be part of the panel for

- [DE315-1 AEC API Talk](http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/?speaker=Jeremy+Tammik&year=2008) (Thu. 12/4 3:15 pm - 4:45 pm)

The full class schedule for AU 2008 has been published on Joseph Wurcher's

My presentations are part of this year's Developer Track sessions presented by colleagues from the Autodesk DevTech and various Engineering teams. Kean Walmsley has presented the
[full list of Developer Track sessions](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/au-2008-class-s.html)
on his blog
[Through the Interface](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com).

I very much hope I will get a chance to meet some of you in person at AU!
