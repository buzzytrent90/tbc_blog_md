#### No Cost for Autodesk University 2020
There is [no cost for Autodesk University 2020 – you can go ahead and just register](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/blog/Announcing-AU-2020-Dates-and-Pricing-2020).

#### Virtual AEC and BIM360 Hackathon
[BIM 360 Users: Join Us for a Virtual AEC Hackathon](https://constructionblog.autodesk.com/aec-hackathon):
Ready, steady, hack!
AEC professionals are joining up for the first world-wide [virtual AEC hackathon July 10-23](https://constructionblog.autodesk.com/aec-hackathon).
It includes Forge preparation workshops, Autodesk and third-party developers as speakers and two Forge challenges for best projects using Design Automation and the BIM 360 API.
Here is a [succinct live one-minute description of the process and contents](https://youtu.be/57R8DIOqZw0):

#### Do Not Print by Category
[Boost Your BIM](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) shares
a [new free tool and open source initiative – do not print by category/subcategory](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2020/07/06/new-free-tool-do-not-print-by-category-subcategory):
Here is Harry's [3-minute video description and demo](https://youtu.be/Ehas54IxCNo):

#### Using the New Unit API to Display Length of Multiple Lines
Another recent posts by Boost Your BIM discusses how to handle
the [Revit 2021 API Unit API changes](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/2021-changes-units)
by modifying an existing external command that calculates and displays
the [total length of multiple lines](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/total-length-of-multiple-lines):
> Autodesk made a bunch of changes to the Revit API for Units in 2021.
Many frequently-used methods are now marked as obsolete.
They still work fine in 2021 but will probably be removed in 2022.
For one example of how to update your code, this old sample computes the total length of all selected objects and shows the result as a formatted string.
Here is the new code that uses the `UnitFormatUtils` method `Format` taking `Units`, `ForgeTypeId`, `Double` and `Boolean` input arguments...

#### Intro to Synchronous versus Async Programming
Let's end for today with this very nice explanation of synchronous versus async programming:
[how do I think about async code?!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-do-i-think-about-async-code)
Take care.
