### RvtSamples 2019
I already described how I installed Revit 2019,
[compiled the Revit 2019 SDK samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/compiling-the-revit-2019-sdk-samples.html),
migrated [RevitLookup to the new version](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/revitlookup-2019-and-new-sdk-samples.html),
[The Building Coder samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/forge-rvt-to-ifc-adn-xtra-tbc-and-adnrme-updates.html#2),
[the AdnRme MEP HVAC and electrical samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/forge-rvt-to-ifc-adn-xtra-tbc-and-adnrme-updates.html#3) and
the [AdnRevitApiLabsXtra training labs](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/forge-rvt-to-ifc-adn-xtra-tbc-and-adnrme-updates.html#4).
In the course of the last post, I forgot to mention setting up RvtSamples.
Just like the migration to previous versions, this is not a trivial undertaking.
Here are the discussions of the previous migrations to
the [Revit 2017 SDK](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/rvtsamples-for-revit-2017.html) and
the [Revit 2018](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/sdk-update-rvtsamples-and-modifying-grid-end-point.html#3).
To curt a long story short and simply share my current working RvtSamples source code for the Revit 2019 SDK, here
is [RvtSamples_2019.zip](zip/RvtSamples_2019.zip) containing my modified files.
It also includes some of the originals renamed by adding the suffix `original`.
I hope you find this useful.

Please let me know if you find anything is missing.
Todo: I have not even checked yet whether
the [new Revit 2019 SDK samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/revitlookup-2019-and-new-sdk-samples.html#3) have
been included yet.
I strongly suspect not, sorry to say... stay tuned...
