### Room Renumbering Plugin of the Month

Our latest Plugin of the Month has been released on
[Autodesk Labs](http://labs.blogs.com):
[RoomRenumbering for Revit](http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/02/march-adn-plugin-of-the-month-roomreumbering-for-revit-now-available.html).

For the first time ever, this month's plugin is a Revit add-in, a room renumbering application by Adam Nagy.

It includes source code and full documentation and is intended to be simple enough for any end user interested in customisation to understand and be able to extend for her personal use, so be sure to check it out for yourself!
