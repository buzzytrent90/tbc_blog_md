### Munich API Training

Today is the second day of the Munich Revit API training, with the following participants and a nice mix of interests in formwork and scaffolding, infrastructure, concrete walls and bridges, facade, glass, roof structures, stadiums, parameteric design using Grasshopper and Rhino, generative components, connecting CAD and FEM, bridge engineering in steel and concrete, elevator software and
freelance architect and civil engineering consultancy:

- Anis Naroura- Thomas Jarzyna, Harsco Infrastructure Services GmbH- Kai Timmermann, Harsco Infrastructure Services GmbH- Simon Hooper, Bestech Systems Ltd.- Andre Ihde, PhD TU Munich- Dirk Cleff, Digipara GmbH

Here we are enjoying some wonderful Munich sunshine during our lunch break:

Since everybody completed their
[homework](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/preparing-for-a-hands-on-revit-api-training.html) ahead
of time, we finished with the basics during the first day and were able to start exploring some of the more interesting topics of specific interest to this group:

- More Basics
  - No Revit API
    [object model](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/no-revit-api-class-diagram.html)- Counting items and customizing the bill of material- Geometry extraction by level including non-level based elements- How to discretize circles and arcs- Multilanguage- Levels- Units- Performance- Groups of objects- Connection to Excel, import and export parameters- Creation, modification of layouts, sections, plan views- Recognising neighboring items and boundaries- Extensible storage (xdata)- Family creation
      - Constraining geometry- Structural
        - Link Revit Structure Bridge Extensions with proprietry bridge design software- Extracting geometrical and other information from the Analytical Model- Avoiding connection problems between columns, beams, walls and slabs- REX, the Revit Extensions

For one of the participating companies, the final goal is challenging, to port or rearchitect an existing and mature AutoCAD-based wall formwork application...

In the evening I had a picnic under the
[Monopterus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten#Monopteros) in
the
[Englischer Garten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten) park.
On the way home we enjoyed
[Venus and the new moon](http://earthsky.org/tonight/moon-and-venus-still-highlight-the-evening-sky-april-25) in
the quiet city streets due to the Champion's League semi-final soccer game Bayern Munich – Real Madrid:
