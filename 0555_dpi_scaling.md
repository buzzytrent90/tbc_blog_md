### Handling DPI Scaling in .NET Application Forms

Here is a quick pointer to Kean's post on
[handling DPI scaling in .NET application forms](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/handling-dpi-scaling-in-your-net-applications-forms.html),
in case you missed it.
This issue is obviously relevant in Revit add-ins as well, and was actually encountered by Adam Nagy developing the
[RoomRenumbering for Revit ADN Plugin of the Month](http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins).
