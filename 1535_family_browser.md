### WPF Revit Family Browser and Vacation
Just for your information, I am away on vacation now.
Please don't expect any Revit API related activity from me here, on
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160),
or anywhere else during the coming week.
Happily, I have something else to share with you and possibly help keep you busy and entertained in the meantime:
[Roman Lavrov](https://github.com/RomanLavrov) shared
his [Revit Family Browser](https://github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser), saying:
> I am working on family browser for Revit using Revit API and WPF.
Your blog helps me a lot, so I decide to share my work with you.
I think, some ideas will be useful for other coders.
If you have time, please take a look my program on GitHub
at [github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser](https://github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser).

Many thanks to Roman for sharing his cool utility and source code!
I wish everybody a happy and productive time while I am gone!
