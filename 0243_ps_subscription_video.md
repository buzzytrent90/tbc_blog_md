### Product Support Subscription Videos

I mentioned the
[Revit 2010 Subscription Pack](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/revit-2010-subscription-pack.html) last week,
and Matt Mason highlighted the
[model review](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/model-review.html) add-in
included with it and its little API, which is just one example of all the good stuff in there.
Autodesk Product Support has now published a series of
['deeper dive' subscription pack videos](http://bit.ly/eZEM2) which
cover the subscription pack features and functionality and provide you with a deeper understanding of their use as well as anticipating and answering potential questions.
