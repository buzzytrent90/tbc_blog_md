### Invitation to Autodesk DevDays 2013

While I am beavering away at my Autodesk University material, or at least should be, instead of answering developer cases and blogging, my colleagues are equally busy preparing the upcoming
[Autodesk Developer Days](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/back-and-preparing-the-au-and-devdays-conferences.html#2).

As you can see from the
[DevDays schedule](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/back-and-preparing-the-au-and-devdays-conferences.html#2),
there is only a week to go before it starts off in Asia and Australia.

This time around, for the first time ever, we are also actively looking to engage with non-ADN members who would like to attend.

If you are interested in joining – and are not currently an ADN member – please
[contact the ADN team](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=473880).
There is no a requirement to become a paid member of ADN in order to attend, but you will need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), since we will be presenting confidential material about technology that has not been publicly announced.

This is a great way to get early information on what the various Autodesk product divisions are planning, which is obviously extremely valuable for envisioning your own development roadmap.
You just cannot talk about confidential content with anyone who is not bound by the same NDA before a public announcement has been made.

I will be attending the event at Autodesk University in the USA and all the events in Europe, taking place in December,
  إن شاء الله
  ([insha'Allah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insha%27Allah), God willing).

It would be a pleasure to see you there!
