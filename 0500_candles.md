### Pointless 500th Post with Candles

This post is almost pointless.

Actually it does have one point and one point only: to point out The Building Coder 500th post anniversary.

Yippiiee!

I would like to celebrate this with lots of candles:

Really it even has two points, because we are here in Gothenburg in Sweden, and today just happens to be one of the most special days in the Swedish calendar,
[Luciadagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy%27s_Day),
[St. Lucy's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy%27s_Day),
a celebration of light in the darkness:

I had not thought about that at all, but luckily there was both a bunch of kids singing in the hotel reception when we left in the morning, just like in the little movie above, as well as a couple of people from the neighbouring bank standing in the street outside the Autodesk office when we arrived, offering coffee and a

everybody passing by.
Mmmhhh!
