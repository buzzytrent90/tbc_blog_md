### ADN Revit 2015 API Training Material

The ADN Revit API Training Material available on GitHub from the
[RevitTrainingMaterial repository](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial) has
now been updated for the Revit 2015 API.

Here is a direct link to download it as a
[zip archive](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial/archive/master.zip).
The Revit 2014 version is still available as
[release 2014.0.0.0](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial/releases/tag/2014.0.0.0),
and the Revit 2015 version – obviously – as
[release 2015.0.0.0](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial/releases/tag/2015.0.0.0).

#### Tech Summit Preview Recording

In case you are interested in listening to what I plan to say about my enhanced cloud-based round-trip simplified 2D BIM editor at the internal Autodesk Technical Summit in Toronto next week, here is the:

- [33-minute preview recording](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/room_editor_2/preview/jeremy_tammik_room_editor.mp4)

Enjoy.

#### Cynicism

Before signing off for today, let me mention two nice and rather positive quotes on cynicism that I just encountered and enjoyed:

Cynicism is...

- ... expecting nobody to be anything that I am not myself

       – [Elias Canetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Canetti)
- ... the successful attempt to see the world the way it really is

       – [Jean Genet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Genet)
