### Write Revit Add-ins No Coding Experience Required

Adam Sheather of [YTL Corporation](http://www.ytl.com/) created and presented a complete and in-depth Revit API introduction titled
*Learn to Write Add-ons No Coding Exp Required!* for
[RTC](http://www.rtcevents.com),
the Revit Technology Conference 2014, held in Australia, Europe and North America.

He describes it like this: This course is for expert users of Revit who wish to learn how to code. This will cut a lot of non essential information from standard and other coding classes to get users quickly up to speed writing basic add-ons and give people tools to discover and develop tools independently.

Adam very kindly provided all the class handouts and sample material in the
[Gytaco RevitAPI](https://github.com/Gytaco/RevitAPI) repository
on GitHub.

For a first quick impression of the layout, here is the overall lesson plan:

- Lab 1 – Computing Essentials, Visual Studio and First Project
- Lab 2a – Revit API Pre-Starters, Setup and VSTA
- Lab 2b – Select Objects, get data, set data, export/import data
- Lab 3 – UI Setup, Project Templates, Views
- Lab 4 – Export/Rename, Place Families, Create Floors, Events

For a slightly deeper preview, here are direct links to local copies of his class handouts and two useful C# and Revit API cheat sheets:

- [Talk 2](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/github/Gytaco/RevitAPI/Handouts/Revit_API_talk_2.pdf)
- [Talk 3](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/github/Gytaco/RevitAPI/Handouts/Revit_API_talk_3.pdf)
- [C# cheat sheet](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/github/Gytaco/RevitAPI/Handouts/Cs_Cheat_Sheet_THE_CODING_GUYS_1_of_2.pdf)
- [Revit API cheat sheet](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/github/Gytaco/RevitAPI/Handouts/RTC2014_Revit_Cheat_Sheet_2_of_2.pdf)

Please go to the
[GitHub Gytaco RevitAPI repository](https://github.com/Gytaco/RevitAPI) to
download the originals, though, if you want to take a deeper look.

Many thanks to Adam for all his work creating and sharing this material!
