- [Zurich hackathon projects and winner: Immersive](#2)
- [Solitude and relaxation at the Flueseeli Lake](#3)
- [Project Memento and a webinar](#4)
- [More job opportunities](#5)

#### Zurich Hackathon Projects and Winner: Immersive

The
[Zurich hackathon](http://hackzurich.com) completed with
[101 new projects submitted](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackzurich-2014/hacks).

The winner, both overall and of the Autodesk 'best 3D app' challenge, is
[Immersive](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackzurich-2014/hacks/immersive)
([GitHub repository](https://github.com/schickling/immersive)).

Congratulations!

It uses regular smartphones and inexpensive devices like Google Cardboard to create an immersive stereoscopic virtual reality impression.

Scenes are shot using two smartphone cameras to create a stereoscopic effect.

Even the mount for the recording camera devices was custom made with the 3D printer provided by Autodesk during the Hackathon.

All rendering is done inside the browser of your smartphone using WebGL and ThreeJS.

#### Solitude and relaxation at the Flueseeli Lake

I recuperated from the Zurich hackathon with a quick hike in the mountains, from Lenk up to the
[Flueseeli Lake](http://www.fluhsee.ch).

On my way up, I helped a farmer beside the path to saw a log of wood:

The lake provides both solitude and relaxation.

Here is an impression of the solitude – I am in the middle of it, relatively small indeed:

This is what my relaxation can look like:

Aaah.

#### Project Memento and a Webinar

[Project Memento](https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=D69655022B4F42C880513D4E3085C7D0) is
an Autodesk Labs technology preview of an end-to-end solution for converting any reality capture input (photos, scans) into high quality 3D mesh that can be cleaned up, fixed, and optimized for Web and mobile experiences, for further digital use or for fabrication.

You can sign up for a
[free project Memento webinar](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/473223072) if
you like.

#### More Job Opportunities

Autodesk is still hiring.

We have lots of opportunities for software engineer and other clever and motivated people interested in cloud, mobile, modelling and 3D technologies, especially in Hyderabad, Montreal, San Francisco, Shanghai and Singapore.

Shoot me a note if you would like to work for one of the recognized top worldwide employers.

#### My Favourite Books

I love reading, when I find the time.

I actually still read books printed on paper.

No kindle, no screen, no digital – real paper, dead trees (sorry!).
