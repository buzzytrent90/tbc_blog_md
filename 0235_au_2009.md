### AU 2009

These days I am pretty occupied with the preparation of my sessions for
[Autodesk University 2009](http://au.autodesk.com):

- [**CP308-2** All Systems Go in the New Autodesk Revit MEP API](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=5269)
- [**CP9118-1** The New Autodesk Revit Family API: Everything is Relative](https://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=5265&jid=323682)

The Family API one is a virtual class which requires special preparation, since it is being recorded and broadcast worldwide for
[Virtual Autodesk University](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=virtual_home&pre=1).
As
[Rick Graham](http://www.civil3d.com/2009/10/autodesk-university-virtual) pointed out,
virtual AU was created for those who are not able to make it to Las Vegas in person, and is free for subscription customers.

Here are links to the
[standard class catalogue](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class_listing&filter_date=&filter_time=&filter_room=&filter_type=&filter_track=&filter_software=&filter_speaker=114824) and the
[virtual classes](https://au.autodesk.com/?nd=virtual_class_listing&speaker_filter=114824#classlisting).

I would love to see you in person in the classroom session,
or chat with you live during one of the virtual ones.
