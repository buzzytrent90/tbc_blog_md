### Online Revit API Help

On Monday, we pointed out that the
[Revit product help is available online](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html).

[Rod Howarth](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com)
responded with a comment mentioning his very useful custom Google search for
[global online Revit API help](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=003379886482190238526:wi7yjrtrkd8).

Rod also published a
[blog post](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/revit-api-search-engine.html)
providing some background info on his centralised search engine.

Many thanks to Rod for providing this powerful time-saving tool!
