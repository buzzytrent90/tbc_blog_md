### Registration Open for Autodesk University 2013

Registration is now open for
[Autodesk University 2013](https://events.au.autodesk.com).

It is easier this year, because you use your Autodesk account (Autodesk ID).
If you don’t have one, you can easily
[create it](http://au.autodesk.com/create-account/faq) during
registration.

The [AU website](http://au.autodesk.com) has been updated to help you find all of the [preconference events](http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference) scheduled for Monday, the [classes and hands-on labs](https://autodesk-uat.activeevents.com/connect) that might interest you, and [other activities](http://au.autodesk.com/plan/overview) taking place during the conference.

All industry specific activities and class highlights are listed on focused pages for

- [Product design & manufacturing](http://au.autodesk.com/plan/industries/product-design-manufacturing),
- [AEC, infrastructure, and oil & gas](http://au.autodesk.com/plan/industries/aec),
- [Media & entertainment](http://au.autodesk.com/plan/media-entertainment), and
- [Education](http://au.autodesk.com/plan/education).

You can save up to $500 by [signing up](https://events.au.autodesk.com) before October 20.

I mentioned my three classes when pointing out the
[class catalog preview](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/open-mep-connector-warning.html#2).

I am looking forward to seeing you there.
