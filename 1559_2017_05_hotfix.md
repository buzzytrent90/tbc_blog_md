### Hotfix Resolves Export and Print Issue
Here is just a quick note to begin the week with the good news that the Revit 2018 issue reported in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [Revit 2018, DWF, shaded views, and Windows explorer bug](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-2018-dwf-shaded-views-and-windows-explorer-bug/m-p/7043102) is
resolved by the hotfix to handle
the [product crash when communicating with licensing server](http://knowledge.autodesk.com/article/Product-crash-when-communicating-with-Licensing-Server-Hotfix).
![Hotfix May 20](img/2017-05-20_hotfix.png)
The problem can apparently also occur when exporting or printing views.
This affects several ADN cases and development database issues, e.g.,
- 12919761 \*Revit 2018, DWF, Shaded Views, and Windows Explorer - Bug\*
- 12894987 \*Revit crashes when exporting / printing Sheets via API while a modal dialog is open\*
- REVIT-112605 \*RVT 2018 crash involving DWF, shaded views and Windows explorer -- 12919761\*
- REVIT-112607 \*Revit crashes when exporting / printing Sheets via API while a modal dialog is open -- 12894987\*
- REVIT-112150
- REVIT-112561
To reproduce:
1. Open the rac_basic_sample_project.rvt project that is installed with Revit 2018
2. Go to Add-Ins > Export Crash Sample > Open Window
3. Click Export or Print
The sample project is specifically printing / exporting sheet A101, but I'm seeing the issue on just about every sheet in that project.
I've only seen the crash handling dialog once and I submitted a CER for it. Every other time I get the Windows dialog saying Revit has stopped working.
Please apply this fix if you have encountered anything similar.
