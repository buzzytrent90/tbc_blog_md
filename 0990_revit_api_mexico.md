### Spanish Revit API Training in Mexico

Hello.

I am not really back yet, but my vacation is slowly drawing to a close, and I checked my email.
Here is the first result of that:

My colleague
[Augusto Gonçalves](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/augusto-goncalves.html) from
the ADN team in São Paulo is providing two days each of
[AutoCAD.NET and Revit API training](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/entrenamientos-api-espanol.html) in
Mexico and in Spanish on September 3-4 and 5-6, respectively.

Here are direct links to the
[course descriptions](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/entrenamientos-api-espanol.html) and
[registration page](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/entrena_API).

Now to enjoy the last couple of hours before returning to work seriously...
