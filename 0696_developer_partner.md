### Finding a Development Partner

I was able to recuperate a bit from the previous weeks' travels and conferences in Milan this weekend, where I did very little except feel exhausted and ill.
Now I am fine again, though, and arrived safely for the developer conference and DevLab here in Farnborough in the UK.
The plane last night was late, of course, so I checked in way after midnight, but at least we all made it here this year :-)

Now and then, people ask me how they can locate a Revit developer to implement something for them, either for personal use or as a commercial application.

One thing that I can point you to is the official Autodesk list of ADN developer partners at
[partnerproducts.autodesk.com](http://partnerproducts.autodesk.com) >
[Professional Services](http://partnerproducts.autodesk.com/catalog/industry.asp?Industry=PSVCS).

Another place you can look and also post a request for proposals is the Revit API discussion forum at
[forums.autodesk.com](http://forums.autodesk.com) > Autodesk Revit > Autodesk Revit API.

Then we have a number of well-known independent developers, many of whom have both asked questions and contributed solutions to this blog, such as
[Guy Robinson](http://redbolts.com) (NZ),
[CADWorks](http://www.cadworks.net),
[NTI CADcenter](http://nti.dk/forside.aspx) and
[CAD-Q](http://www.cad-q.com) (Scandinavia),
[GEM Team Solutions](http://www.team-solutions.de) (Germany),
BIMWare,
CADSoft,
etc.

You can also obviously post a comment below and see whether anyone responds to that, regardless of whether
you are offering some Revit API development service or if you are searching for some or have a RFP.

Some additional general advice: when hiring someone to perform a service, you might want to ask for contact details of three prior customers of theirs, so that you can talk to them.
Hiring a consultant is not that much different from hiring an employee, so it is prudent to perform a careful interview and check the references.

Obviously, check for existing built-in functionality and existing applications before you even start dreaming let alone thinking of creating a custom solution.
[BIMapps](http://bimapps.typepad.com) may help with the latter.

Good luck!
