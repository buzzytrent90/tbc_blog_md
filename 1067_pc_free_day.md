### A Pee Cee Free Day

I celebrated my birthday with a PC-free day.

My colleague Joe Ye sent me a nice (digital) cake from Beijing:

Joe points out that the character on the cake means longevity or birthday, and peach is the traditional food for birthdays.

Thank you, Joe!

I completely avoided starting up the computer, not even to listen to music or fiddle with photos.

I shot a couple, though, on a nice long autumn walk:

What a huge beautiful world we are gifted with!
