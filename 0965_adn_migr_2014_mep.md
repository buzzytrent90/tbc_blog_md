### The ADN Sample AdnRme for Revit MEP 2014

I am back safe and sound in Europe again, and the pressure to complete my preparations for the upcoming
[Moscow Revit DevCamp](http://www.autodesk.ru/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=21516340&siteID=871736) on
June 25th and
the Revit 2014 API training in Sydney in July is gradually growing.

As part of the preparation, I recently migrated the
[The Building Coder samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/migrating-the-building-coder-samples-to-revit-2014.html) and
the
[ADN Revit API training labs](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/migrating-the-adn-training-labs-to-revit-2014.html) to
Revit 2014, followed up by fixing most
[deprecated API usage](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/removing-deprecated-api-compilation-warnings.html) warnings
generated by The Building Coder samples.

I now also addressed the ADN Revit MEP sample
[AdnRme](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html),
which turned out to be very easy indeed.

All I had to do was update the Revit API assembly references, and it compiled right away with zero errors and zero warnings.
That was a bit of a surprise.

Here is
[AdnRme\_2014\_0.zip](zip/AdnRme_2014_0.zip) containing
version 2014.0.0.0 of the AdnRme sample for Revit MEP 2014.

One thing I plan to do real soon now is post and host the ADN sample material on GitHub to make is easier to maintain and collaborate on.
