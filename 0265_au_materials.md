### AU is not done yet

Here are some updates on AU and the class materials.

#### Class Materials

Several people have inquired where the class materials suddenly disappeared to.

The AU 2009 classes will soon be available online.
Starting Friday, December 11,
[AU Online](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=home) will
have all of the class handouts, presentation materials, data sets, and screencasts of more than 500 AU 2009 conference and AU Virtual sessions, so you can access them anytime, anywhere, all year long.
All class materials will be available from the
[class listing](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class_listing).

#### We're not done yet...

[AU Extension](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_autodesk_university_extension) continues
through December 11, 2009 and you can still register.
Over 90 Authorized Training Center sites are offering free training events in 35 countries.
AU Extension is a great opportunity to upgrade your skills and connect with local peers and experts.
