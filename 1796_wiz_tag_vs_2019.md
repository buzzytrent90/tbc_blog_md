### Visual Studio 2019 Revit Add-in Template Tags
A small enhancement to the Visual Studio Revit Add-in Template, and another interesting little AI surprise:
- [Template tags for Visual Studio 2019](#2)
- [My wizard works again](#3)
- [OpenAI plays hide and seek and breaks the game](#4)
#### Template Tags for Visual Studio 2019
[WinterXMQ](https://github.com/WinterXMQ) submitted
[pull request #10 – Add template tag for Visual Studio 2019](https://github.com/jeremytammik/VisualStudioRevitAddinWizard/pull/10) to
the [Visual Studio Revit Add-In Wizards](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.20), saying:
> Support for Visual Studio 2019, but not tested in the other versions of Visual Studio.
![Template Tags for Visual Studio 2019](img/winterxmq_wizard_tags.png)
I integrated the request in [release 2020.0.0.3](https://github.com/jeremytammik/VisualStudioRevitAddinWizard/releases/tag/2020.0.0.3).
Many thanks to WinterXMQ for this enhancement!
#### My Wizard Works Again
That prompted me to finally get my wizard working again on my new PC.
It previously was not, and I had no idea why.
The StackOverflow answer on [no templates in Visual Studio 2017](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41189398/no-templates-in-visual-studio-2017) prompted me to check my VS settings in Options > Projects and Solutions > Locations.
Lo and behold, the content was messed up (by Parallels?).
Resetting it to the default \*C:\Users\jta\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\* fixed everything, and I was able to verify that the wizard still works for Visual Studio 2017 after the addition of WinterXMQ's new tags.
#### OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek and Breaks the Game
Another amusing and fascinating example of AI coming up with unexpected innovative solutions is described by the three-minute video
on [multi-agent hide and seek](https://youtu.be/kopoLzvh5jY):
> We’ve observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing a simple game of hide-and-seek.
Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported.
The self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behaviour.

More detail is provided in the corresponding article
on [emergent tool use from multi-agent interaction](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use).
