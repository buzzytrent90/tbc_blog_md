### C# and .NET Little Wonders

I arrived safely in Las Vegas after my various
[travel snafus](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/failure-api-take-two.html).

Checking email before bed, I discovered a wonderful new
[post of Kean's](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/11/cnet-little-wonders.html) that
I like so much I will simply go ahead and reproduce it in its entirety:

[James Michael Hare](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/Default.aspx) has
published a great series entitled "C#/.NET Little Wonders":

- [C#/.NET Five Little Wonders (part 1)](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/08/26/c.net-five-little-wonders-that-make-code-better-1-of.aspx)
  1. The Null Coalescing Operator ??- The As Cast- Auto-Properties- The Stopwatch Class- TimeSpan factory methods- [C#/.NET Five More Little Wonders (part 2)](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/09/02/c.net-five-more-little-wonders-that-make-code-better-2.aspx)
    1. string.IsNullOrEmpty() and string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace()- string.Equals()- using Statements- static Class Modifier- Object and Collection Initializers- [C#/.NET Five Final Little Wonders (part 3)](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/09/09/c.net-five-final-little-wonders-that-make-code-better-3.aspx)
      1. Implicit Typing- LINQ Extension Methods- Extension Methods- System.IO.Path- Generic Delegates- [C#/.NET Two More Little Wonders](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/10/21/c.net-little-wonders-todictionary-and-tolist.aspx)
        1. The ToList() LINQ Extension Method- The ToDictionary() LINQ Extension Method

Just like Kean, I use a number of these tips on a regular basis and was familiar with a few others, but the very first one was new to me.

James also published an
[overview](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/11/11/c.net-little-wonders---a-presentation.aspx) linking to these various pages and a
[presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/BlackRabbitCoder/little-wonders-5747749) covering the same ground.

Many thanks to James for creating these and Kean for discovering and pointing them out!
