### Revit 2021.1 and Normalising Custom Export UV
The hottest news for today is the Revit update release, seasoned with other titbits of interest:
- [The Revit 2021.1 update](#2)
- [Normalising UVs in custom exporter](#3)
- [Set up your own free VPN server](#4)
Before we get to those, another nice quote of the week, courtesy of [Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/quincylarson):

> On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.*

#### Normalising UVs in Custom Exporter
Sunsflower (sic) shared a nice explanation in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [`IExportContext` converting `UV` to the range (0,1)](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-iexportcontext-converting-uv-to-the-range-0-1/m-p/9638219):
\*\*Question:\*\* I'm writing an exporter for Revit and encountered with a problem when exporting UV.
When I call `PolymeshTopology.GetUV`, the coordinates given are often larger than 1.
My questions are:
- How can I convert them to the desired range (0,1)? Or how should I understand these UV values?
- Are they coordinates on the image? And If they are indeed coordinate on the image, how can I access the size of the image in `IExportContext`?
To give a concrete example:
Say I have a texture of size 4096x4096, the corresponding `UV` data I read in `IExportContext` is around 25, and the RealWorldScale from the UnifiedBitmapAsset is about 141.
I cannot seem to be able to discern a formula or anything...
\*\*Answer:\*\* Maybe this background information
on [faces and their coordinates in the Revit API](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/faces.html) will
help?
\*\*Response:\*\* That post explains UV as two variables that parametrise a face, but as far as I can see they are related to the structure of the face in 3d space, not how each vertex of the face are mapped to the bitmap.
How can I convert the UV coordinates returned by `PolymeshTopology.GetUV` to pixel coordinates on the image or in the range (0,1).
I found the discussion
on [PolymeshTopology UVs](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/polymeshtopology-uvs/td-p/8641007) to
be relevant, but the answer given is not detailed enough for me to actually solve the problem.
\*\*Later:\*\* Okay, I think I've figured it out and I'll list the solution found just in case someone else also has this problem...
The `PolymeshTopology.GetUV` method returns a `UV` coordinate, which corresponds to the parameters of a face.
Therefore, I guess they are related to the dimension of the face that they parameterize.
These UV coordinates can be converted to display units via `UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits` (which is probably deprecated now, but anyway...).
My add-in uses centimetres.
So far, we have the UV in centimetres.
The next step is to obtain the size of the bitmap.
This is given by the properties with name `UnifiedBitmap.TextureRealWorldScaleX/Y`.
These values are actually given in inches, so you can call `UnitUtils.Convert` from `DisplayUnitType.DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES` to `DisplayUnitType.DUT_CENTIMETERS` to convert them.
In fact, I've found `DisplayUnitType.DUT_FRACTIONAL_INCHES` gives the same result.
I don't know what the difference is... maybe someone could elaborate on that.
After that, the UV coordinates can be scaled to the range [0,1] or whatever.
\*\*Correction:\*\* the `AssetPropertyDistance` class actually has a `DisplayUnitType` property, which should be used instead of the `DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES`.
Many thanks to Sunsflower for this useful research and helpful documentation!

#### Set up your own Free VPN Server
I have not tried this myself yet, but the detailed steps sound perfectly simple, sound and doable in the 5 minute read
on [how to set up your own VPN server at home for free using Linux and WireGuard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-server-at-home):
> This is a great way to boost your own privacy and security without needing to share your data with a paid VPN service.
