### DevLabs and Training

Kean just pointed out that we have scheduled a number of new
[DevLabs](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/01/more-devlabs-currently-planned-for-2010.html) for this year.
Two of them, in Munich and Beijing, will be offering support for Revit developers.

We have also updated the
[API training schedule](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php) (which
you can also access from the easy-to-remember URL
[autodesk.com/apitraining](http://autodesk.com/apitraining)).
It includes some class room trainings on the Revit API.
We are thinking of holding some webcasts on various aspects of the Revit API as well, and will add them to the training schedule once the plans have matured.
