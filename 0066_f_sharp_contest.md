### F# Programming Contest

Kean Walmsley just announced a
[programming contest](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/01/f-programming-contest.html)
using the exciting new
[functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
.NET language
[F#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_programming_language).
Since functional programming has many uses in all realms including architecture, there should be lots of scope for making use of it in conjunction with the Revit API as well.
I hope to install Visual Studio 2008 real soon now and have a look at setting up a basic F# Revit add-in project.
I am very much looking forward to hearing from you about ideas for making use of F# in Revit.
