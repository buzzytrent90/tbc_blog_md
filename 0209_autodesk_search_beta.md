### Autodesk Search Beta

We recently mentioned two new online search possibilities, the availability of
[online help for the Revit product](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html)
and Rod Howarth's customised
[global Revit API search](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-api-help.html).
Here is another note in the same vein:

[Autodesk Search Beta](http://searchbeta.autodesk.com)
is now available and provides a number of new capabilities including:

- Type-ahead.- Did you mean...- Filter by publish date, site source, etc.- Expanded search scope covering discussion forums, blogs, online product documentation, community sites and the Autodesk channel on YouTube.

Please check it out and provide feedback to help validate and fine tune the technology, and possibly justify using it to replace the current search functionality.

I tested the search with the keywords "newsweep revit" and it returned exactly two hits, i.e. not too few nor too many, both of which were perfectly relevant, i.e. no junk.
