### Cloning a Solid, AngelHack, 3D Web Fest and Dubai

The Revit 2016 offers a whole host of exciting new functionality that I am dying to try out, e.g.:

- [Custom exporter supports 2D output](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.04)
- [Improved ReferenceIntersector linked model support](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.10)
- [DirectShape supports curves, points and references](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.16)
- [Cool new Geometry API functionality](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.03)

And [much, much more...](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html)

Too little time!

At least I can mention one useful aspect of the new geometry API that came in handy for an issue that came up yesterday.

I am in Dubai right now, preparing for the AngelHack Hackathon.

Here are the topics for today:

- [3D Web Festival in San Francisco](#2)
- [AngelHack in Dubai](#3)
- [AngelHack in Athens](#4)
- [Autodesk University proposals](#5)
- [Cloning a solid](#6)

#### 3D Web Festival in San Francisco

Hey, there is this really cool event coming up in San Francisco on May 13th,
the [3D Web Festival](http://www.3dwebfest.com),
sponsored by Autodesk, Goo Technologies and Leap Motion:

If you know any folks in the Bay Area who might be interested in seeing and experiencing what's possible today with 3D on the web, please let them know.

#### AngelHack and I♥3D in Dubai

As said, I am in Dubai right now, for the first time in my life.

Here are my
[first impressions](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10205533066578928.1073741833.1019863650&type=1&l=507a3cff85) wandering
around
[Jumeirah Beach Residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumeirah_Beach_Residence) aka JBR.

Tonight we hold the
[AngelHack Dubai Pre-Hackathon Meetup and Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Dubai/events/221497781)
to get all interested
[AngelHack Dubai Hackathon](http://angelhack.com/hackathon/dubai-2015) participants
up to speed on the View and Data API in preparation for two hot and frantic days of hacking over the weekend – which is Friday and Saturday here, of course.

#### AngelHack and I♥3D in Athens

We also just held the inaugural
[I love 3D – Athens](http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Athens) meetup,
on April 24th, at
[The Cube](http://thecube.gr),
Greece's biggest coworking space.

Cyrille Fauvel and Peter Schlipf presented the View and Data API, Fusion360, AutoCAD I/O and Recap360 to a group 30 enthusiastic local developers:

![I♥3D Athens inaugural meetup](img/ilove3d_athens_inauguration_406.jpg)

They loved it.

I will be going there too soon, for the
[Angelhack in Athens](http://angelhack.com/hackathon/athens-2015), on June 5-7.

Again, we have scheduled an
[AngelHack workshop](http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Athens/events/221674308) meetup
session on Friday evening to get us all well prepared and up to speed for the subsequent hackathon.

I am looking forward to meeting you there!

#### Autodesk University proposals

The
[Autodesk University Call for Proposals](http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals) has opened.

I am already busy preparing mine   :-)

#### Cloning a solid

Now, finally, back to the Revit API, with a question on cloning solids, very well addressed by one of the Revit 2016 API enhancements:

**Question:** To clone solids, we have been using the following workaround in the past:

```csharp
  static public Solid Clone( this Solid solid )
  {
    if( solid == null )
    {
      return null;
    }
    return BooleanOperationsUtils
      .ExecuteBooleanOperation( solid, solid,
        BooleanOperationsType.Union );
  }
```

This function allows us to clone solids to later use them to create or modify DirectShape elements.
It works very well in the majority of the cases; however, the ExecuteBooleanOperation function throws an exception on some specific DirectShape elements, saying:

- Exception: "Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids. Error: Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions.InvalidOperationException: Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids"

I would be very grateful if you can give me some directions how to fix this issue.

**Answer:** Have you noticed the following new functionality provided by the
[Revit 2016 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html)
[Geometry API additions](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.03)?

#### Solid – copy

The new method:

- SolidUtils.Clone()

creates a new Solid that is a copy of the input Solid.

That looks as if it should solve your problem for you more elegantly and efficiently.

**Response:**
Thanks for the quick answer.

The SolidUtils.Clone method does indeed solve the issue for Revit 2016. It works perfectly. Thanks!

However, what can I do to fix it in Revit 2015?

**Answer:** I am very glad to hear that the issue is solved in Revit 2016 by the SolidUtils.Clone enhancement.

For Revit 2015 and previous versions, a better workaround, rather than unioning the original solid with itself, might be to union the shape with a small cube (1" x 1" would work for most shapes) located in the interior of the shape.

**Response:** Thank you!

I can confirm that the workaround solves the issue I was having with the Revit 2015 API.
