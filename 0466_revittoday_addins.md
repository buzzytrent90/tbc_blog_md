### RevitToday Add-Ins Import and Export Coordinates

Renzo van Rijswijk of
[Strukton Engineering bv](http://www.struktonengineering.com) just pointed out that he offers some free Revit add-ins on his blog
[RevitToday](http://revittoday.blogspot.com):

- [Import coordinates into Revit 2011](http://revittoday.blogspot.com/2010/10/import-coordinates-into-revit-2011.html) for
  importing coordinates from a TXT file.
  You are free to select a family of your own.
  It should be a Point Based family of course.

- [Export XYZ from Revit 2011](http://revittoday.blogspot.com/2010/09/export-xyz-from-revit-2011.html) to
  export all coordinates of Point Based Generic Models to an Excel file.
  You can locate Point Based Generic Models in your whole model.
  You are able to nest such a Family within another.
  These points are exported as well when you make this family Shared.
