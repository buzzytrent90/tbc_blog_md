### Revit and Navisworks API Wishlist Surveys

This year's Revit and Navisworks API wishlist surveys are now open, as
[Mikako Harada pointed out](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/api-wishlist-survey-for-revit-and-navisworks.html) on the AEC DevBlog.
Here are the direct links to them:

- [Revit API wishlist survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FR9A8WHJ9)- [Navisworks API wishlist survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FRMLV62H3)

The API wishlist survey with your feedback on your API needs has a strong influence on the direction of the future API. so please take the time to fill it out.
Your feedback will not fall on deaf ears.
It will take less than five minutes to complete each survey.

Well, actually, to tell the truth, it took me almost ten to do the Revit one.
There are some pretty interesting questions in there.

Our engineering teams use this feedback to help prioritise the areas of API enhancements in coming releases.
If you wish, you can leave your e-mail address and we will send you the final results when they become available.

The deadline for the Revit and Navisworks surveys is **June 1, 2012**.

The wishlist surveys for other products will follow shortly.

Thank you in advance for your participation!
