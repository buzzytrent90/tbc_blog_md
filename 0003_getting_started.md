### Getting Started with the Revit API

A good overview over the basic resources available for getting started with the Revit API, or Application Programming Interface, is given on the Revit Developer Center page at

<http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=2484975>

You can also easily find this page by searching for the keywords "revit devtv". The DevTV Introduction to Revit Programming is a self-paced video tutorial demonstrating how to get started developing with Revit. This page points to the public Revit API discussion group and the possibility to join ADN, as well as providing links for downloading the SDK or Software Developers Kit, which is also included in every Revit product installation.

Happily, absolutely everything you need to get started with the Revit API is included with the basic Revit product. If you want to write a professional application, you will additionally need a .NET development environment. However, for exploring the API and creating macros, the built-in VSTA or Visual Studio Tools for Applications editor can be used.

The DevTV recording is based on Revit 2008. The principles remain the same in Revit 2009, except that element access has been tremendously speeded up by the implementation of filtered access.

There is a recording available of a Revit 2009 API webcast that we held in May 2008. It covers more or less the same material as the DevTV recording, and additionally discusses the filtering features added in the 2009 API. This recording is available to ADN members only, at

<http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&id=11272567&linkID=4901650>

This link also includes the materials presented, i.e. the presentation itself and the source code of the individual sample commands or labs.
