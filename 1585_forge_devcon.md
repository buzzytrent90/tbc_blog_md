### Forge DevCon at AU in Darmstadt and Las Vegas
I'll be attending the
two [Autodesk University conferences](http://au.autodesk.com) in
Darmstadt, Germany, October 17-18, and Las Vegas, USA, November 14-16.
Both of these are preceded by a [Forge DevCon developer conference](https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2017).
You may be interested only in Revit and its API or other desktop oriented programming and asking yourself why you should care about Forge and all that cloud stuff.
If so, you might want to expand your horizon and take a look at Stephen Preston's analysis and explanation in his article
on [developing for Autodesk desktop software? Here's why you should care about Forge DevCon (and Autodesk University)](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/developing-autodesk-desktop-software-heres-why-you-should-care-about-forge-devcon-and-autodesk).
He addresses the following topics in detail:
- What’s this Forge thing, again?
- Ok, but why will coming to Forge DevCon help me?
- I’m an AutoCAD developer. How will it help me?
- What about Revit developers?
- Inventor? Fusion?
- And what about Autodesk University?
- You had me at ‘DevLab’. Where do I sign up?
- I don’t live in the US, and I don’t plan to visit. Where else can I learn about Forge?
If that gets you hooked, here is the next place to visit:
