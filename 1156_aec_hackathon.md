### AEC Hackathon – From the Midst of the Fray

The New York
[AEC Symposium and Hackathon](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/aec-hackathon-in-new-york-and-new-developer-guide-url.html) is
nearing its conclusion.

The end and final result demos are scheduled for Sunday noon, coming up all too soon.

A
[bunch of us](http://va3c.github.io/#team) have
been working non-stop through the night since Saturday morning.

It is now early Sunday morning, and coffee is eagerly awaited by all.

I am participating in a pretty big project to implement a general-purpose 3D AEC model viewer.

It is designed to consume models defined in three.js JSON scene format, and to produce suitable JSON models from a host of different sources, including Rhino, Grasshopper, 3dsmax and Revit.

We baptised ourselves **va3c** and grouped around our new GitHub organisation
[**va3c** – view 3D AEC building models in any web browser with three.js](https://github.com/va3c).

The
[va3c project landing page](http://va3c.github.io/)
displays the main projects addressed:

- [viewer](https://github.com/va3c/viewer) – HTML viewer
- [GHva3c](https://github.com/va3c/GHva3c) – Grasshopper va3c exporter
- [RvtVa3c](https://github.com/va3c/RvtVa3c) – Revit va3c exporter
- 3DS Max – JSON Exporter Max Script
- Sketchup – Export to DAE Collada & View
- [json](https://github.com/va3c/json) – JSON sample files
- [va3c](https://github.com/va3c/va3c.github.io) – web viewer for AEC models

Take a spin with the
[va3c viewer demo](http://va3c.github.io/viewer) for
a quick and immediate impression of what we have achieved so far.
