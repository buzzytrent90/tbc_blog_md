### Obfuscation

In response to the
[last post](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/converting-between-vb-and-c-and-net-decompilation.html),
[Rod Howarth](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com)
brought up the related topic of
[source code obfuscation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated)
for a .NET assembly. He says:

Reflector is certainly a useful tool, and its good to delve into both your own code and other namespaces. It can greatly assist with understanding code and also disaster recovery, in the case of lost source files.

A related topic is
