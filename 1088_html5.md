### HTML5 for Teaching Maths and Physics

Good morning and welcome to this new week.

I am pretty busy right now, so I will just recommend taking a look at something not related to the Revit API:
[Mathigon](http://world.mathigon.org),
a stupendously beautiful interactive didactical mathematical eBook making advanced mathematical ideas accessible to the general public.
Mathematics has never been so colourful!

Very impressive use of HTML5, JavaScript, etc.

It reminds me of the
[JavaScript physics sample](http://codepen.io/stuffit/pen/KrAwx) simulating ripping a curtain of tearable cloth that I
[mentioned](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/cloud-based-restaurant-seating-arrangement-and-cleaning.html#5) last
spring, showing an extremely compact example using HTML5, Canvas, CSS and JavaScript to implement an interactive graphical physical simulation of a hanging tearable cloth in just three hundred lines of code.
