### API Training and AEC DevCamp Material

I am back again from a wonderful holiday in Greece!
I spent one week in a retreat centre in the village of Kissos, and then a couple of days on the Banika beach north of Agios Ioannis and south of Chorefton.
I was there with a friend, we had a little cooking stove and food for a couple of days, slept on our mats in the sand in a little cave, went swimming and played with the stones on the beach.
One nice novel experience was building a little raft with a couple of empty bottles, sticks and string to carry a five litre canister and swim with it to the neighbouring beach to get some water to live on.

#### Revit API Training

Anyway, now I am back and getting up to speed again with current issues surrounding the Revit API.
This summer, my colleagues and I are holding a number of Revit API trainings around the world.
As always, you can see and register for them in the
[ADN API training schedule](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php).
