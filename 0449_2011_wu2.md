### Revit 2011 Web Update 2

I am currently attending an Autodesk-specific non-technical training in a pretty posh old English manor house,
[The Elvetham](http://www.elvethamhotel.co.uk).
Apparently, Queen Elizabeth I planted an oak tree here which is still standing,
and King Henry VIII met one of his wives here, back in the sixteenth century.

In more recent news, a colleague just pointed out the
[Revit OpEd](http://revitoped.blogspot.com) blog
featuring a concise and clear overview of the newly released
[Revit 2011 web update 2](http://revitoped.blogspot.com/2010/09/revit-web-update-2-posted-subscription.html), which is build 20100903\_2115, and
its relationship to other upcoming updates.

The web update of Revit 2011 can be downloaded from the public Revit product pages:

The first update in June, Revit 2011
[Web Update 1 (WU1)](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-2011-web-update-1.html) is
included in Web Update 2 (WU2), so it is not necessary to install WU1 first.

Here is the list of the WU2 API enhancements which extend the
[WU1 ones](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-2011-web-update-1.html) and are also applicable across all three flavours for Architecture, MEP and Structure, copied out of the enhancements list documents Enhancements\_List\_RAC\_2011\_UR2.pdf and the same for RME and RST:

- Setting formula for Manufacturer/Type Comments as string no longer throws an exception.- Improves consistency between User Interface and API when using Family Type count.- Improves the consistency of maintaining the preview image when Save/SaveAs.- Improves the consistency of creating the detail curve when the views detail sketch plane is not located where expected within the database.- Improves detail curve creation when the view does not have an implicit sketch plane.

The RME enhancement list mentions the following two additional MEP specific API enhancements:

- Cabletray Connector Angle property no longer throws an exception when rotating a
  cabletray.- MEP API: The following Electrical Parameter Types have been exposed to DB.ParameterType:
    - CABLETRAY\_SIZE- LOADCLASSIFICATION- ELECTRICAL\_TEMPERATURE- ELECTRICAL\_DEMAND\_FACTOR- CONDUIT\_SIZE
