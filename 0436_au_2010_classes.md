### Autodesk University 2010 Classes

Kean's post on
[AU 2010 classes](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/08/au-2010-classes.html) yesterday
reminded me that I might mention my upcoming classes here as well.
The catalogues of both physical and virtual classes have been posted to the
[AU website](http://au.autodesk.com):

![AU 2010 classes](img/au_2010_classes.jpg)

My classes are the following:

- **CP228-2**: [Optimal Use of New Autodesk Revit 2011 Programming Features](#1), a lecture on Revit 2011 API features in general, on Tuesday 2010-11-30 14:00-15:00.- **CP234-2**: [Exactly What You Want and Faster: Autodesk Revit 2011 Programming Optimization](#2), a lecture on Revit 2011 API optimisation, including a number of filtering techniques and benchmarks, on Tuesday 2010-11-30 17:00-18:00.- **CP316-3U**: [All Systems Go in Autodesk Revit MEP Programming](#3), an 'Unconference' together with Martin Schmid on the Revit MEP API on Wednesday 2010-12-01 at 8:00-9:00 (this class was previously numbered CP333-4U and scheduled for Wednesday 2010-12-01 at 16:30-17:30).

#### Optimal Use of New Autodesk Revit 2011 Programming Features

This class teaches everything you need to know
about the new Revit 2011 programming features and
how to use them, with many code examples, making
use of all new API features in all types of Revit add-ins.
We also present the one and only complete
overview of all new Revit 2011 SDK samples.
Special attention is paid to Idling, the most exciting
and unique new event of all, with examples of
powerful uses of this unique possibility to
synchronize your Revit add-in with external data
sources and applications.

#### Exactly What You Want and Faster: Autodesk Revit 2011 Programming Optimization

This class goes one step beyond the optimal use of
the new programming features. It performs some in-depth
analysis and benchmarking of the many
different ways to use the most fundamental access
to Revit database elements: the filtered element
collector. This class covers techniques to efficiently
extract elements and information from a Revit
model. The new collector framework introduced in
the 2011 release includes much more flexibility than
before. Along with the flexibility comes some
complexity. We demonstrate the best approaches
for common element gathering tasks, discuss the
new filters including logical and inverted aspects,
show how the iteration framework can be used with
Microsoft .NET LINQ, discuss regeneration topics,
and share a few auto-join performance tips.

#### All Systems Go in Autodesk Revit MEP Programming

This class discusses the possibilities and optimal
use of the Revit API to create, analyze, and modify
Revit MEP models programmatically. It addresses all
MEP domains including HVAC, electrical, and
plumbing. It discusses all MEP model components
such as mechanical and electrical systems, ducts,
pipes, fittings, connectors, and the new cable trays,
conduits, and panel schedules. Topics include in-depth
analysis and traversal of systems, automatic
splitting of parts, obstruction avoidance, routing
automation, and conduit and cable tray layout. We
will discuss the standard Revit MEP SDK sample
applications, as well as custom ones to convert
pipes to conduits; layout of cable tray elements and
fittings; display of electrical system hierarchies in a
tree view; and automatically calculate, size, and
report performance of an HVAC system that is
based on room requirements.

As an 'Unconference', this session is actually not a lecture or class at all, but rather a discussion group co-led with Martin Schmid to share and discuss Revit MEP application development experiences among peers.
I am very excited to see how this one goes, and also how Martin will juggle his many commitments to fit this one in!

I am very much looking forward to these sessions and hope to see you in Vegas!

Until then, lots to prepare, as usual...

By the time you read this, I will have left on yet another vacation, this time northwards, to go sailing along the coast of Norway and Sweden, from Stavanger to Göteborg.
That will be the last one for a while, I promise!
