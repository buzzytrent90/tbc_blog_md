### Family API Labs for Revit 2011

Someone very friendlily pointed out that the
[Family API labs](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/revit-family-creation-api-labs.html) available
from The Building Coder are only provided for the Revit 2010 API and asked for a revised version based on Revit 2011.
Due to the extent of the changes between the two API's, the previous samples do not run with Revit 2011.

Thank you for pointing that out!

Here is the current version of the
[Family API Labs for Revit 2011](zip/rfa_labs_2011-02-01.zip).
