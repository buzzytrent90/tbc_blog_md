### Revit API Resource and Getting Started Guide

I was very enthusiastic about
[Rod Howarth's Autodesk University presentation](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/au-winds-down.html),
and especially the Revit API resource guide and suggestions for getting started with the Revit API that he presented in the second half.

Rod has now very friendlily published his
[Revit API Resource Guide](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com/2010/03/revit-api-resource-guide-free-download.html).

To whet your appetite for having a closer look at this invaluable information, here is a table of contents I put together:

#### Resource Overview

- C# / VB.Net Resources
  1. Get a good book- View information online- SDK Samples
    - SamplesReadme.htm- Developers Guide- Compiled HTML Help File- Webcasts- Autodesk University- Blogs- Revit API search engine- Online Forums- Autodesk Developer Network- RvtMgdDbg

#### The Process

1. Learn how to do it manually- Identify key words / areas- RvtMgdDbg- Search SDK Samples + Developers Guide
         1. Search through the SamplesContent.htm file- Search through Visual Studio- Search through Windows Explorer- Search CHM- Search Online- IntelliSense / Experimentation- ADN / Forums

Very highly recommended!

Thank you very much, Rod, for making this available!
