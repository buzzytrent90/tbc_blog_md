### Revit 2015 and Updated SDK Released

Here is just a quick note to tell you that Revit 2015 was released today, and you can now download it from the
[Autodesk Revit product site](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-revit-family/free-trial).

The Revit 2015 SDK (Software Developers Kit) is also available from the
[Revit developer center](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).

Please note that is was updated today, to replace a previous premature posting.

If you happened to download the Revit 2015 SDK already in the past few days, please replace it now with the updated version labelled April 11.

Please also note the
[Revit 2015 API News – DevDays Online Recording](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/revit-2015-api-news-devdays-online-recording.html) posted
two days ago.

It provides and overview and some code samples demonstrating the new functionality.

As always, the complete description is provided in the What's New section of the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm, included in the SDK.

As you hopefully already noticed,
[RevitLookup for Revit 2015](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/revitlookup-for-revit-2015.html) was
already published on GitHub and is no longer included in the Revit SDK.

I wish you a wonderful weekend, and lots of fun exploring the new features!
