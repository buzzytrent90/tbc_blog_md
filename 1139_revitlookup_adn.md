### RevitLookup for UR1, ADN, AEC and AU News

Here are some of the non-confidential items from the new confidential April 17 Autodesk Developer News newsletter, plus one or two additional items of interest from myself and elsewhere:

- [AEC Technology Symposium](#2)
- [Migrate Autodesk Exchange Apps and publish 2015 versions](#3)
- [Proposals for Autodesk University 2014](#4)
- [Proposals for Autodesk University Germany 2014](#5)
- [Autodesk ReCap Connect Partnership Program](#6)
- [RevitLookup for Revit 2015 UR1](#7)
- [Happy Easter!](#8)

#### AEC Technology Symposium

I already pointed out the upcoming
[AEC Technology Symposium](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/no-devcamp-better-ny-aec-technology-symposium.html) in
New York City on May 16-18.

I mentioned the bad news, the absence of our bi-annual AEC DevCamp this year, and the good news, namely our participation in this event.

The best news of all is that I will be able to participate myself, so I hope to see you in New York a month from now.

The symposium itself is held on Friday the 16th, followed by a
[Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) over the weekend.

You can learn more and register for the event at
<http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014>.

I hope to meet many of you that attended the AEC DevCamp in the past, and also get to know many new developers interested in cutting edge AEC technology, BIM 360, Dynamo, Revit, and non-Autodesk AEC technologies too.

#### Migrate your Autodesk Exchange Apps and Publish 2015 Versions

Customers are actively looking for 2015 versions of their favourite add-on tools, so make sure your apps are ready and available.
Don't miss out on the opportunity to be found by all the new customers moving to Autodesk's 2015 solutions.

Please direct any questions on migrating your existing apps to
[appsubmissions@autodesk.com](mailto:appsubmissions@autodesk.com).

If you are submitting new apps, review the information at
[www.autodesk.com/developapps](http://www.autodesk.com/developapps).

#### Autodesk University 2014 Call for Proposals Coming Up

You certainly know about AU, Autodesk University, Autodesk's largest annual user conference, with hundreds of classes and labs taught by top-notch instructors and industry professionals.

If you're interested in becoming a speaker at
[Autodesk University](http://au.autodesk.com) this
year, you can now sign up to be notified when the AU 2014 Call for Proposals opens.

Speaker benefits include enhancing your reputation and increasing your networking opportunities, as well as speaker honoraria.

For further details visit
<http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/overview>.

Obviously, as always, I plan to submit a couple of proposals myself.

#### Autodesk University Germany 2014 Call for Proposals

Besides the main Autodesk University event in Las Vegas, I am also hoping to attend the
[German venue in Darmstadt](https://cluster.ems-secure.de/registrations/autodesk/au.2014/ems.registration.php?s=main.summary.welcome&l=de&xid=8icbqrtfhpc93lu58imeuju7i4&tracking=D0000000000&s=main.summary.welcome) this year, October 23-24.

The
[call for proposals for Autodesk University Germany 2014](https://cluster.ems-secure.de/registrations/autodesk/au.2014/ems.registration.php?s=main.summary.welcome&l=de&xid=8icbqrtfhpc93lu58imeuju7i4&tracking=D0000000000&s=main.lecture.welcome) is
already open, and I plan to submit some here as well.

#### Autodesk ReCap Connect Partnership Program

You certainly know about ReCap, the reality capture functionality producing 3D point clouds and models from a series of 2D pixel images, e.g. normal camera snapshot photos.

Autodesk now announced the
[ReCap Connect Partnership Program](http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2014/04/autodesk-announces-recap-connect-partnership-program.html) covering
several different methods to programmatically connect to and make use of this service:

- Capture Codec Kit
- Embedded ReCap OEM program
- ReCap Photo Web API

#### RevitLookup for Revit 2015 UR1

I published
[RevitLookup for the Revit 2015 Meridian pre-release PR10](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/revitlookup-for-revit-2015.html) before
the final customer release, which ended up being UR1.

The complete source code, Visual Studio solution and add-in manifest, is provided in the
[RevitLookup GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup),
and the new UR1 version is stored there as
[release 2015.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2015.0.0.1).

I changed nothing from the PR10 version, except updating the Revit API references, so the compilation obviously still generates the same
[19 warnings](zip/revit_lookup_2015_warnings_02.txt) as before.

#### Happy Easter

I am visiting my sister Helene in the
[Provence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence) in southern France for a few days, enjoying spring and the
[Easter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) holiday.

![Happy Easter!](img/easter_bunny_postcard_1907.jpg)

Happy Easter to you too!
