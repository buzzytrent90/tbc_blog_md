### Revit API Introduction Webcast Recording

The recording and materials of the Revit API Introduction webcast presented on May 20 2010 by Adam Nagy and Saikat Bhattacharya is available from the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) DevTech
[API Training & Consulting](http://autodesk.com/apitraining)
page, following the
[webcast archive](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php) link
and filtering for 'Revit API' and 'English'.
Select the download link to obtain the archive file RevitAPI\_20May2010.zip containing the following four files:

- Revit 2011 API - Intro\_PPT.zip- Revit API Intro Webcast\_May 2010\_Recording.zip- Revit\_API\_Intro\_Webcast\_May\_2010\_QA.docx- RevitLabs.zip

They obviously contain the presentation, recording, questions and answers, and samples, respectively.

The topics covered include:

- Introduction
  - Revit products and SDK- Documentation and samples- Getting Started and Hello World
    - Development environment- External commands and applications- Add-in manifest- RvtSamples- RevitLookup (formally known as RvtMgdDbg)- Database Fundamentals
      - Understanding the representation of Revit elements- Element iteration, filtering and queries- Element modification- Model creation- UI Topics
        - Ribbon- Selection- Task dialogue- Events- Dynamic model update

The labs used to explain the basics of the Revit API have been rewritten from scratch, and the introduction is much more effective and easier to follow now than the one we used in previous versions.

The presentation is also completely new and very didactically designed, so it should provide a good starting point for anyone wishing to get into the Revit API, regardless of whether you have had a look at it in previous versions of the product or not.
