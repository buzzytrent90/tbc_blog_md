### Matt Mason's API News

I just noticed from Matt Mason's
[comment](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/plugin-migration-steps.html?cid=6a00e553e168978833013480152d31970c#comment-6a00e553e168978833013480152d31970c) on the
[plug-in migration steps](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/plugin-migration-steps.html) that
he is running a very interesting
[series of posts on the new Revit 2011 API](http://cadappdev.blogspot.com/2010/03/revit-api-2011-edition-whats-new.html) as well.

Here is his current table of contents:

- Upgrading Existing Revit API commands/applications- New Deployment Methods- The New UI vs. Database split.- New Ribbon Capabilities- Element Iteration Changes- Ooh-ooh Pick Me! New Selection Methods- Dynamic Model Update- Event Model Changes- RevitLookup: The New RevitMgdDbg- Whats New in Element Creation?- What Kinds of Applications are Possible Now?- And More...

Some of the topics have already been posted, others not yet.
We have covered some of the areas here as well, but several not, such as the new
[ribbon capabilities](http://cadappdev.blogspot.com/2010/03/revit-api-2011-user-interface.html) and
[selection methods](http://cadappdev.blogspot.com/2010/03/revit-api-2011-ooh-ooh-pick-me.html).

Great stuff, Matt, and thank you very much for pointing it out!
