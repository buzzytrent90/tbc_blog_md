### MEP Sample Code for Revit 2012

One of my sessions at
[Autodesk University 2011](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e2011) is
**CP4453** Everything in Place with Revit MEP Programming.
It will cover both the new
[Revit MEP 2012 API features](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/the-revit-mep-2012-api.html) and
the
[Revit MEP API in general](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/the-revit-mep-api.html).

In preparation for that, as well as preparing new samples, e.g. on
[placeholder elements](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/mep-placeholders.html),
I am also updating the existing material, especially the ADN Revit MEP sample code.

The old Revit 2011 material from AU 2010 is available online, for instance from the list of all sessions in the
[Revit API track at AU 2010](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/the-revit-api-track-at-au-2010.html) and
for Revit MEP from my
[Revit MEP 2011 API class materials](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/autodesk-university-2010-class-materials.html).
They are also available directly from the
[CP316-3U All Systems Go in Autodesk Revit MEP Programming](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&session_id=6882&jid=620080) page
in the AU site itself.

So, after all that retrospective introspection, here is
[rme\_src\_2011-08-09.zip](zip/rme_src_2011-08-09.zip) containing
the flat migrated sample material for Revit MEP 2012.
The descriptions of the features implemented provided by last year's handout material still apply.

#### Upcoming Revit API Training Classes

There is still time to sign up to attend our classroom-based training sessions coming up this autumn.
Please take a look at the
[API training schedule](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php) and the
[course descriptions](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=785271) to
find out if you could benefit from attending one of these classes.

The next classes discussing the Revit API are listed by filtering for "Revit API":

- Aug 25 2011 – Chennai, India, English- Sep 29 2011 – Sao Paulo, Brazil, Portuguese
