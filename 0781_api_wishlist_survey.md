### API Wishlist Survey Deadline Looming

I returned safe and sound from Boston and the AEC DevCamp and started recuperating from the intensive week at the conference and DevLab.
I love being back home again!

The
[Revit and Navisworks API wishlist surveys](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/revit-and-navisworks-api-wishlist-surveys.html) opened
back in May.

In the meantime, the Civil 3D and Inventor ones were launched as well.

Kean just announced an
[extension of the deadline](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/06/api-wishlist-surveys.html).

I would like to join him in urging anyone who has not already submitted their wishes to do so as soon as possible:

- [AutoCAD Civil 3D](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FSEYSMJ86)
- [Autodesk Inventor](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FVZCJTCQN)
- [Autodesk Navisworks](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FRMLV62H3)
- [Autodesk Revit](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FR9A8WHJ9)

The API wishlist survey with your feedback on your API needs has a strong influence on the direction of the future API, so please take the time to fill it out.

Our engineering teams use this feedback to help prioritise the areas of API enhancements in coming releases.
If you wish, you can leave your e-mail address and we will send you the final results when they become available.
