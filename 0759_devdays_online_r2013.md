### DevDays Online on What's New in Revit 2013

A recording of the "What's New in the Revit 2013 API" presentation from the DevDays conferences that we presented on the world-wide tour during the winter months is now live, both by selecting "DevDaysOnline-Revit2013API" in the
[public ADN webcast recording archive](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php)
([download recording](http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/DevDaysOnline-Revit2013API.zip))
and on the members-only
[ADN web site](http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&id=19231929&linkID=4901650).

The 88 MB download contains the following:

- Recording – MP4 and supporting files (73,682,898 bytes)- Presentation – DevDays Online - Revit 2013\_Whats New.pptx (4,915,103 bytes)- Sample code
      - ReadMe.txt- RoutingPreferenceAPI- ScheduleAPI- StairsAPI- UIAPI

The samples have also made it into the
[updated Revit 2013 SDK](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/developer-center-and-sdk-update.html) by
now.

The presentation includes a product overview and a summary of the new API features, obviously going into much more detail than my recent brief
[overview of Revit 2013 and its API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/revit-2013-and-its-api.html).

To give you an idea of the new product features, here is the list of main Revit 2013 product related projects:

- Construction, Fabrication and Engineering
  - Construction Modeling- Fabrication Platform- Precast Elements- Reinforcement Detailing- Point Clouds- Piping & System Routing- Customer Requests- Platform Scalability
    - Revit Server- Performance- Countrification
      - Stairs & Railings- MEP Centerlines- IFC API- Suites & Interoperability
        - First Experience- Revit One Box- Consistent Visualization- Translation Fidelity- Add-In Integration- View API- Visualization API- Suites Visualization Workflows- Inventor Interoperability API- Analysis & Simulation
          - Physical Properties- Structural Analysis in BIM- Structural Code Checking- Analysis Visualization- Analytical Volumes- MEP Calculations

For more details on the new product features, you can check out the

- [New feature videos](http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2013/Help/00004-Video_Galleries/2013_New_Feature_Videos) and- [What's New section](http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2013/Help/00002-New_in_Revit_2013) in the developer guide.

On the API front, I mentioned the main topics already in my
[Revit 2013 API overview](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/revit-2013-and-its-api.html),
without, as said, being able to go into as much detail as this presentation does.

Many thanks to Saikat Bhattacharya for creating this recording!
