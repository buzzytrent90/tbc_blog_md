### API Wishlist Survey

The Summer 2009
[Revit API wishlist survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229BU6PH7J9)
is now ready and will remain open until **July 31st, 2009**.
Please take the time to fill out the survey.
The engineering team uses the feedback you provide to prioritise our API development efforts.
This is a great chance for you to have a direct impact on the direction we take in exposing APIs to our products.
