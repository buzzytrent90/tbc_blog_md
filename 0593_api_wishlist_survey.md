### API Wish List Survey Reminder

This year's
[API wish list surveys](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/api-wishlist-survey.html) were initially scheduled to close last week:

- [AutoCAD](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QA2TDYR)- [AutoCAD Civil 3D](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9Q8JTD3G)- [Revit](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QACTE6V)- [Autodesk Inventor](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QBPTEZ5)- [Autodesk Navisworks](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QBRTF2C)- [Autodesk 3ds Studio Max](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22CAV8THY63)- [Autodesk Maya](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22CAV7HHXCE)

Kean just informed us that the
[deadline was postponed](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/06/api-wishlist-surveys-reminder.html) until **June 17th, 2011**, and **July 3rd, 2011** for the last two products, which were added to the list later.

Please take the time to fill out the ones of interest to you, if you have not already done so.
They really help drive the API development in the direction of greatest importance for you.
Thank you very much!
