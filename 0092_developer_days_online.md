### Developer Days Online

Kean just revealed our plans for
[Developer Days Online](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/02/developer-days-online.html),
where we present overviews of the upcoming new Autodesk products and their APIs.
The AEC related presentation will take place on February 12, 2009 at 4pm GMT, 5pm CET, 8am PDT, 11am EST and last for about two hours.
The topics we plan to cover are the Revit 2010, AutoCAD Architecture 2010 and AutoCAD MEP 2010 product features and API updates.
There will be one earlier presentation covering AutoCAD, and later ones on Geospatial, Manufacturing and Civil 3D.
All of the Developer Days Online presentations will be held online via Microsoft LiveMeeting and a conference call.
To register to attend any of these online events,

stating which sessions you wish to attend and we will reply with the LiveMeeting and conference call details.
