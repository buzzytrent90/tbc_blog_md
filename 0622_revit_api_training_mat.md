### Revit API Training Material

The Revit 2012 API training material that we use for our ADN trainings is now available online to the general public from the
[Revit Developer Center](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).
Here is a
[direct link](http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/revit_2012_api_training.zip) to
it, with no guarantee that it will remain valid in future.

It includes three subfolders:

- Labs- Presentation- Sample Drawing

These are the Powerpoint presentations used for the training:

- 0\_Revit\_Programming\_Training\_Class.pptx – Overview- 1\_Revit\_API\_Intro.pptx – Basics- 2\_Revit\_UI\_API.pptx – User Interface and Events- 3\_Revit\_Family\_API.pptx – Family API

The labs parallel the three main presentations:

- 1\_Revit\_API\_Intro – Basics- 2\_Revit\_UI\_API – User Interface and Events- 3\_Revit\_Family\_API – Family API

Each of the three labs are provided in both C# and VB, and each also includes a set of documentation, exercise instructions, source code and Visual Studio solutions in the following subfolders:

- DocsCS- DocsVB- SourceCS- SourceVB

The labs in the basic 1\_Revit\_API\_Intro cover the Revit API fundamentals:

- Revit add-ins: external command and application, attributes, add-in manifest and object model- Representation of Revit elements- Element iteration, filtering and queries- Element modification- Model creation

These topics are split up into the following exercises:

- Lab1 – "Hello World"- Lab2 – DB element- Lab3 – element filtering- Lab4 – element modification- Lab5 – model creation- Lab6 – extensible storage- Lab7 – shared parameters

The topics covered by 2\_Revit\_UI\_API include:

- Ribbon- User Selection- Task Dialogue- Events- Dynamic Model Update

Finally, 3\_Revit\_Family\_API follows the same structure as we already presented when discussing the
[Revit Family API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html) and the
[family creation API labs](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html#4).
