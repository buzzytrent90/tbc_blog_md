### BIM365 Getting Started, Materials API, CPU Voltage
As mentioned, [I am on vacation](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/element-identifiers-in-rvt-ifc-nw-and-forge.html#6) right now,
enjoying splendid weather camping on the coast of the Atlantic.
Meanwhile, here are a few items that cropped up in the past few days:
- [Getting started and programming buttons with Revit API](#2)
- [Links to API to modify visual appearance of materials](#3)
- [Improving performance by optimising CPU voltage](#4)

#### Getting Started and Programming Buttons with Revit API
Zach Smith reached out and pointed to his new
blogging platform [BIM365](https://www.bim365.tech) together
with collaborators Matt Boltik and Andrell Laniewicz:
> BIM365 is a blog written by BIM users for the BIM industry. With contributors from various backgrounds, focuses, and skills, this blog aims to be a collaboration for BIM minds.
His first two posts are of interest to all Revit API aficionados:
- [Getting Started with Revit API](https://www.bim365.tech/blog/programming-buttons-in-revit-b7bjm)
- [Programming Buttons in Revit](https://www.bim365.tech/blog/programming-buttons-in-revit)
Welcome to the Revit API blogosphere and thank you for sharing, Zach!
#### Links to API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials
For the sake of completeness, here is the official link to the information presented by Boris Shafiro at Autodesk University 2017:
- [New API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials in Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/New-API-Modify-Visual-Appearance-Materials-Revit-2017)
The Building Coder presented some of the material in the discussion
on [modifying material visual appearance](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/11/modifying-material-visual-appearance.html).
This new link includes the full collection of class materials:
- Overview
- Video – 45 minutes
- Handout – 21 pages
- Presentation – 33 slides
#### Improving Performance by Optimising CPU Voltage
Daniel Gijsbers noticed the description and solution to
my [MacBook Pro overheating problem](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#5) and
very kindly responded:
> I read your [blog post](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#4).
Regarding your mac book having heat problems, it’s good you cleaned the fans.
> What you could also look into is
whether [improving performance by optimising CPU voltage](https://danielgijsbers.blogspot.com/2018/10/performance.html) is
also possible for a mac.
Basically, I lower the voltage to my CPU to the point it is just stable; with that reduction, I can run the processor at a higher clock speed.
