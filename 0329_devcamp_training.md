### DevCamp, Devlabs and Updated API Training Schedule

#### DevCamp

Registration for the AEC DevCamp on June 7-9, 2010, in Boston, MA has opened.
This is the software developer conference for anyone considering or actively developing applications and integrations with Autodesk architecture, engineering, and construction technologies.
Besides all versions of Revit, this also includes AutoCAD Architecture, Navisworks, and the infrastructure technologies Civil 3D, Map 3D and MapGuide Enterprise.

During the three days, we will be holding more than twenty training classes on the various APIs, including introductory classes for people just starting to customise and advanced topics for professional developers.
There is also a business track for software business owners.
Here are some of the beginner classes, most of which are targeted at Revit:

- Introduction to .NET programming for non-programmers- What's new in Revit 2011 and how to use it- Introduction to the Revit API – Part 1 and 2- Leverage your content creation using the Revit API- Revit Structure API: analytical model and rebar- Introduction to Navisworks .NET API- AutoCAD MEP API programming- Introduction to the AutoCAD Civil 3D .NET API- An introduction to AutoCAD .NET API programming- An introduction to AutoCAD Architecture .NET API programming

These are some of the expert classes:

- Presenting your analysis data in Revit- Creating and analyzing conceptual massing geometry with the Revit API- Analyze geometry of buildings using the Autodesk Revit API- Tips and tricks exploiting the Revit 2011 API- Dynamic interactions with the Revit model- The Revit MEP API- AutoCAD MEP content creation – best practices from an expert- AutoCAD Civil 3D alignments and profiles automation in .NET- AutoCAD Civil 3D styles and command settings automation in .NET- Surface manipulation through the AutoCAD Civil 3D COM API from a .NET application- Migrating AutoCAD Civil 3D subassemblies from VBA to .NET and introduction to pipe rules- The AutoCAD Map 3D workflow API- MapGuide Enterprise application development using FUSION Technology- VBA to .NET migration

There is also a track of classes on sharing, including

- The Doctor is in – bring your personal development challenges, problems and needs to get expert advice and help- AutoCAD Civil 3D .NET usability study with your input!- Talk to the Revit Product Managers- Talk to the Civil 3D Product Managers

And finally, a dedicated business track covers topics such as teaming with the Autodesk sales team and resellers, leveraging your relationship with Autodesk, and understanding Autodesk mergers and acquisitions.

I am very excited about this event, partly since I will be giving some of the presentations myself, and partly because several of the expert classes will be presented by members of the Revit development team and are guaranteed to contain in-depth information that is new to me and not obtainable elsewhere.

Here is the
[full agenda](http://devcamps2010.autodeskevents.net/index.cfm?event=cms.page&id=SIDA52A4B9ECB4B258834668C7926A5EC42),
and further information and registration access is available from the
[DevCamp 2010 website](http://devcamps2010.autodeskevents.net/index.cfm?event=cms.page&id=SID3FA5EEFA001D080A3456040FDD1BD93C).
An early bird discount rate applies until April 30, 2010.

#### API Training Schedule

It is still a while before that becomes imminent, though.
Meanwhile, I am still working full tilt on preparing the upcoming Revit API training for Warsaw.
It will be based on the new version of the API, so there is a lot of stuff to update to get all the samples working and the documentation adapted.
We updated the
[API training schedule](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php) (which
you can also access from the easy-to-remember URL
[autodesk.com/apitraining](http://autodesk.com/apitraining)).
It includes both class room and webcast trainings on the Revit API.
To see them all, simply select 'Revit API' from the 'Course' pulldown.
Due to increasing popular demand and also because quite a lot has changed in the Revit 2011 API, we have more class room trainings scheduled this year:

- April 7 – Warsaw
- May 4 – Farnborough
- Jul 22 – Beijing
- Jul 27 – Munich
- Aug 12 – Chennai

#### DevLabs

The DevCamp is directly followed by one of the
[DevLabs](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/01/more-devlabs-currently-planned-for-2010.html) that
we are holding and which are both free and open to all developers, completely independently of ADN membership, and also listed in the training schedule.
Please note that the Waltham one directly after DevCamp was not present in the original list published by Kean.
Our current schedule includes the following DevLabs with support for Revit development:

- June 10-11 – Waltham, USA –
  [register](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=6703509&siteID=123112&cname=DevLab%20(AEC),%20Waltham,%20Jun%2010%202010,%20200858)- June 21-25 – Munich, Germany- August 9-10 – Beijing, China

Please also note that when I last looked, these three all had different course descriptions in the training schedule.
To find all three of them, you had to search for the following three separate descriptions:

- DevLab (AEC)- DevLab (AutoCAD, Inventor & Revit)- DevLab (Revit and Inventor)

So, lots of events, lots to prepare, lots of exciting meetings to look forward to!

I hope to see you at one of these venues!
