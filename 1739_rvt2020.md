### RevitLookup and SDK for Revit 2020
Happy Easter!
I've been too busy in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) lately to
blog properly.
The post on \*What's New in the Revit 2020 API\* is overdue... for the time being, of course, you can refer to the documentation included with the Revit 2020 SDK, either \*Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx\* or the corresponding section in the help file `RevitAPI.chm`.
I promise you there is some really juicy stuff in there!
Here are some other quick notes anyway as an Easter present for you:
- [RevitLookup for Revit 2020](#2)
- [Revit 2020 SDK posted](#3)
- [Generative Design with Philippe Starck](#4)

#### RevitLookup for Revit 2020
I migrated [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) to Revit 2020.
No source code changes at all were required; I just updated the Revit API DLL assembly references and edited the readme file to
create [RevitLookup release 2020.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2020.0.0.0).
In addition, Harry Mattison of [Boost your BIM](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) very
kindly provided a ready-built new installer in his post
on [RevitLookup for Revit 2020](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/revit-lookup-for-revit-2020), saying:
> I’ve added some conditional compilation and multiple configurations so that the single solution can be used to build against any version of Revit 2017-2020.
For manual installation, all releases are also provided as [pre-built versions generated by CI](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup#-builds)
at [lookupbuilds.com](https://lookupbuilds.com).
#### Revit 2020 SDK posted
Last week, I described how
I [installed the Revit 2020 SDK](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html) from
the Revit 2020 installation `Setup.exe`
and [set up RvtSamples](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html#8) for it.
Now, in addition, the Revit 2020 SDK has also been posted to
the [Revit developer centre public web page](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit),
so you can access it from there independently of the Revit product installation.
#### Generative Design with Philippe Starck
Autodesk announced a
joint [collaboration of an algorithm with star designer Philippe Starck to create the first commercial product made using generative design](https://www.fastcompany.com/90334218/this-is-the-first-commercial-product-made-using-generative-design),
a chair that will soon go on sale:
