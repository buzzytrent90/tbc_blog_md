### Update API Assembly References and Wizards

I finally completed my disk clean-up and managed to install the Autodesk Building Design Suite Ultimate 2013.
Phew.

#### Update API Assembly References

That requires me to update the Revit API references in the projects I am working on accordingly.

In order to easily compile all the SDK samples, I always create copies of the Revit API assemblies in the default installation locations for Revit Architecture, MEP and Structure.

Here is the batch file cprvtapi.bat that I used to achieve this after installing the onebox version of Revit 2013:

```
@echo off
set a=C:\Program Files\Autodesk
set b=Revit 2013\Program

set c=Revit Architecture 2013\Program

copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPI.dll" "%a%\%c%"
copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPIUI.dll" "%a%\%c%"
copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAddInUtility.dll" "%a%\%c%"

set c=Revit MEP 2013\Program

copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPI.dll" "%a%\%c%"
copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPIUI.dll" "%a%\%c%"

set c=Revit Structure 2013\Program

copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPI.dll" "%a%\%c%"
copy "%a%\%b%\RevitAPIUI.dll" "%a%\%c%"

set a=
set b=
set c=
```

#### Autodesk University Proposals Confirmed and Requested

I was notified yesterday that my AU proposals were accepted, so now I know where I will be spending my next birthday again.

I will be presenting two lectures and participating in one panel with members of the Revit API development team and ADN DevTech AEC workgroup:

- CP4107 Let's face it: New Autodesk Revit 2013 UI API Functionality- CP4108 Revit MEP Programming: All Systems Go- CP4109 Revit API Round Table: Meet the Champions

One advantage of these two lectures is that the AEC DevCamp class material can be reused for preparing them:

- [1-4 Revit 2013 UI API enhancements](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/devcamp-day-two.html#2)- [2-7 Revit MEP API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/devcamp-day-two.html#5)

Another advantage is that they have consecutive numbers, making them easier to remember for me :-)

Whereas the live AU proposals have been submitted and processed by now, the
[Autodesk University Virtual call for proposals](http://auspeaker.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/calling-all-au-virtual-proposals) just
opened and we are eagerly awaiting your submissions.

#### Updated Revit Add-in Wizards for C# and VB

After finally installing the official release of Revit, I updated my Revit add-in wizard and also re-implemented the VB one.

Basically, all that needed doing was to replace all occurrences of "Revit Quasar RP" by "Revit 2013" in the \*.csproj and \*.vbproj project files.
They occur in the StartProgram and HintPath tags.

The boiler-place code now creates a 'using' statement around the dummy transaction, and I changed the default version strings in the assembly properties from "1.0.0.0" to "1.0.\*" to take advantage of the automatically generated build numbers.

For the full description of the wizards, please refer to these previous posts:
