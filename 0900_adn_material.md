### ADN Revit API Training Material Update and Vacation

After cleaning up the usage of
[deprecated Revit API calls](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/eliminating-compiler-warnings-and-deprecated-calls.html) in
The Building Coder samples, I decided to clean up the ADN training material as well.

My original plan was to remove all warnings about deprecated API usage, only I quickly discovered there were none to remove :-)

In the MEP sample application
[AdnRme](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html),
I just updated the year listed in the copyright message to 2013 and produced AdnRme version 2013.0.2.0.

I then did the same for the
[ADN Revit API Training labs](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/xtra-adn-revit-2013-api-training-labs.html) and the
[Revit Structure API samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/the-revit-2013-structure-api.html).

Here is the result of that,
[adn\_src\_2013-02-15.zip](zip/adn_src_2013-02-15.zip),
containing the following solutions and projects:

- lab
  - 1\_Revit\_API\_Intro- 2\_Revit\_UI\_API- 3\_Revit\_Family\_API- XtraCs- XtraVb- rme
    - AdnRme- rst
      - labs- link- NewRstLab- RstAvfDmu

#### Vacation Time

This is the last post before my vacation.
Well, actually, this is already during my vacation.

I am hopping on a train in a minute and departing for Italy with unknown itinerary and goals.
A possible candidate is Lecce, in the far south.

I'll be back in two and a half week's time, and keep you posted, maybe.

Bye!
