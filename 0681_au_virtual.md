### AU Virtual and Collaborative Translation

Here are two noteworthy recent little news items on

- [Registration for AU Virtual](#1) and the- [Collaborative translation of Homestyler](#2).

#### AU Virtual

Registration has opened for
[Autodesk University Virtual](http://bit.ly/u1uX1W) with
its live and on-demand classes.
It is free for students and educators:

The Autodesk student and educator community has free access to Autodesk University Virtual from November 29-30.

AU Virtual provides an opportunity for engineers, architects and designers to discover the latest trends and technologies via an online event with live and on-demand classes, clinics and keynotes presented by leading industry professionals.

This free registration offer is valued at $139 USD.

My modest contribution is on the Revit MEP API,
[CP4453](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&session_id=9267&jid=1727895) Everything
in Place with Autodesk Revit MEP Programming.

Another noteworthy AU Virtual class is held by [Rod Howarth](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com) on the
[Revit Server](http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/09/revit-autodesk-university-2011-virtual.html),
to which I published a
[little introduction](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/access-transmissiondata-of-central-file-on-revit-server.html) just
the day before yesterday.

Here is an overview of other
[Revit and AEC API classes at AU 2011](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/revit-and-aec-api-classes-at-autodesk-university.html).

#### Collaborative Translation of Homestyler

I discussed the possibility demonstrated by Kean Walmsley of using UI Automation and hooking up machine translation to
[translate the Revit tooltips](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/translate-revit-tooltips.html),
which was later turned into the full-fledged
[TransTips ADN Plugin of the Month](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/transtips-adn-plugin-of-the-month.html) for
all four products AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit and 3ds Max.

At the same time we are seeing improvements in the help systems by integrating support for collaboration and community building, e.g. for the
[WikiHelp-based Revit API Developer Guide](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/revit-api-developer-guide-on-autodesk-wikihelp.html).

Now the first steps are being made to integrate collaborative support to localise a complete product: Homestyler into Russian.

If you are interested and know at least a bit of Russian, please log in to
[translateit.autodesk.com](http://translateit.autodesk.com) and
join the 150+ translator community to help support this effort.
