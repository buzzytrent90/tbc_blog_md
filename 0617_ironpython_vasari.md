### Python Shell in Revit and Vasari

Finally!
I was always so excited about
[Daren Thomas' RevitPythonShell](http://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell) which
[I pointed to](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/revit-python-shell.html)
[now and then](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/dynamically-load-and-debug-plugins.html)
[in the past](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/09/access-to-curtain-grid-panels.html).

Now
[Zach Kron of buildz](http://buildz.blogspot.com/2011/07/iron-python-scripting-in-revit.html) and
[Nathan Miller](http://nmillerarch.blogspot.com/2011/07/ironpython-with-vasari.html) picked
up this theme again and show how to
[install and run](http://nmillerarch.blogspot.com/2011/07/ironpython-with-vasari.html) RevitPythonShell
using IronPython in Vasari:

Too good to miss!
