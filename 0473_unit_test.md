### Unit Testing in Revit

[Rod Howarth](http://roddotnet.blogspot.com) just pointed out an interesting
[AUGI thread](http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=98536) on

[Python Shell](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/revit-python-shell.html),
for his view, which I find illuminating, and which you can enjoy now as well:
