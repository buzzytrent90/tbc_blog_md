### Kean on Reflector

I repeatedly mentioned the topic of
[converting between C# and VB](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/converting-between-vb-and-c-and-net-decompilation.html),
and how I use the
[Reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector)
tool for this task, for example to
[convert Revit SDK samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/vb-samples-and-other-questions.html#2).

If you are as keen on Reflector as I am, you will probably find Kean Wamsley's series on the new
[Reflector pro](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/02/debugging-into-autocads-net-api-layer-using-reflector-part-1.html)
version very interesting as well.
