### AppHack 2, Training Material and the Developer Guide

Let me talk today about the second edition of the
[AppHack contest](#4),
[ADN Revit API training material](#3) and
[developer guide](#2).

#### Revit 2013 API Developer Guide PDF

As you know, the Revit API
[Developer Guide](http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2014/Help/3661-Developers) is
[online only](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/developer-center-and-sdk-update.html#0)
and has been so since the Revit 2013 timeframe.

I am a great fan of quick ubiquitous immediate access to information, including offline, so I would love a PDF version of it as well.

Nor am I alone in this, as you can see from the
[comment](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/developer-center-and-sdk-update.html?cid=6a00e553e1689788330168eb02f9f5970c#comment-6a00e553e1689788330168eb02f9f5970c) by
Rudolf Honke and the more recent Autodesk discussion forum thread on
[where to get a PDF version of the 2013 API developer guide](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Revit-API/Where-can-I-get-the-PDF-version-of-2013-API-developer-s-guide/td-p/3912669).

Happily, the cavalry came galloping to the rescue there in the form of
[Keldar67](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/706452),
who says:

I agree...
I wanted to access this on my iPad so I could read it on the way to and from work with no Internet access... So I spent quite a few hours copying and pasting into word, formatting and then PDF'd it...
(Yes... Sad I know!)
I read it online when I can so will pick up any updates...

I'd like to be able to download the 2014 version, can't imagine doing that again...

Here are the resulting
[PDF files on dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kv28m0f4yb7aax9/LyNg1yVMmd).
They were created in early August 2013 from the Autodesk wiki as it stood at that point in time and are offered with no warranty...

Many thanks to Keldar67 for providing this valuable tool!

I find it important enough to repost the two PDFs he provides here as well, just in case the DropBox link ever disappears:

- [Revit 2013 API Developer Guide](zip/Revit_2013_API_Developer_Guide.pdf)
- [Revit 2013 API My First Plug-in Training](zip/Revit_2013_API_My_First_Plug-in_Training.pdf)

Who will volunteer to repeat this process for Revit 2014?

#### ADN Revit API Training Material on GitHub

Here is something else that is available online only, to download for offline use only:

As recently
[announced](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/08/announcement-revit-api-training-material-is-now-available-on-github.html) by
my colleague
[Gopinath Taget](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/gopinath-.html),
the ADN Revit API Training Material is now available on GitHub from the
[RevitTrainingMaterial repository](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial).
Here is a direct link to download it as a
[zip archive](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial/archive/master.zip).

This is the latest version of the training material, for Revit 2014.

The Xtra labs that were used before the introduction of the new material are not included and are still maintained separately by Jeremy.
The latest version of those, including the entire standard ADN training material, is
[version 2014.0.0.3](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/adn_labs_2014_3.zip),
presented with the updated
[built-in parameter checker](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/10000000000th-post-and-element-type-parameters.html#3).

#### AppHack 2.0 – Win $5000 Connecting to the Cloud

##### Win up to $5000, a newly released tablet computer and a trip to Las Vegas!

APPHACK 2.0 is a virtual code-fest to produce apps and plug-ins for AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor and BIM 360 Glue. The theme of the event is *Connecting Autodesk to the Cloud* – and **is open to creative interpretation**. Perhaps you can think of a way to wire our software into your favorite social media network or make use of infinite cloud computing to carry out CPU-intensive tasks. Or maybe you have a way to help users better visualize and share their ideas using a web browser. Build a standalone app for an AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor or a BIM 360 Glue product. Or build an app that takes advantage of the integration capabilities of BIM 360 Glue with either of the three other AutoCAD, Revit or Inventor product families. It’s up to you. Code a new app, finish coding one you already have in progress or submit one you already have but haven’t published yet.

More details about the event are provided by the
[main AppHack 2 announcement](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html).

Please note that AppHack is open to ADN members and US residents only.
See the competition page for more details.
