#### Compiling Add-Ins for Multiple Revit Versions
I met [Sander Obdeijn](http://buildingknowledge.eu/about) at several Autodesk, Forge and Revit and came to value his deep Revit experience, both in the user interface and API.
Happily, Sander now says, I'm also joining the blogosphere and my opening post will be about using custom MSBuild target files to easily compile add-ins for multiple Revit versions from the same codebase:
- [Custom MSBuild targets for compiling addins for multiple Revit versions](http://buildingknowledge.eu/custom-msbuild-targets-for-compiling-addins-for-multiple-revit-versions)
That is indeed good news!
Welcome, Sander!
I asked whether his approach might also be used in Visual Studio 2015, and he replies, '.NET core should also work in Visual Studio 2015, but haven’t tested this'.

#### Generative Design for Office Planning
In [The Wilson Quarterly](https://wilsonquarterly.com),
Jeffrey Brown published [This is your office on AI](https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/living-with-artificial-intelligence/this-is-your-office-on-ai).
It features Autodesk's new Toronto office and an interesting four-minute presentation
on [Generative Design for Architecture: Autodesk MaRS Office](https://vimeo.com/193915345):

#### Handy Markdown Tutorial
Just a quick note for my own reference: I discovered
this [very handy Markdown tutorial](http://eherrera.net/markdowntutorial).
I use Markdown a lot for editing text.
Where?
Well, all The Building Coder blog posts are written completely in Markdown.
Please refer to
the [`tbc` GitHub repository for The Building Coder blog posts markdown source](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc).
I also use Markdown all the time every day to write and edit messages in [Slack](https://slack.com).
