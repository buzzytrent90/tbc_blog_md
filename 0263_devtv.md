### Updated DevTV Introduction to Revit Programming

The
[Revit Developer Center](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=2484975&siteID=123112) proudly presents
an updated version of the **DevTV Introduction to Revit Programming**
for Revit 2010, which is now available in both English and Portuguese:

Oh dear, Saikat just pointed out that the online viewing links apparently do not work here, they only work when selected on the
[Revit Developer Center](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=2484975&siteID=123112) page.
Sorry about that.

The original version was created based on
[Revit 2008](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/getting-started.html),
and we reused that version for our
[Revit 2009](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/getting-started-with-the-revit-2009-api.html#2) getting started material as well.

Many thanks to Augusto Gonçalves of Autodesk Brazil for creating the updated version for Revit 2010!
