### Revit 2013 Update Release 2

Revit 2013 Update Release 2 is now available.

I found a path to the Revit Architecture update via
[Autodesk Revit Products](http://usa.autodesk.com/revit)

[Services & Support](http://usa.autodesk.com/support)

Phew.
That was rather hard.

A much easier way to reach the exact download I am after is to enter the appropriate string in Google.
That takes me directly to the download page with no need to manually traverse any convoluted paths.

Here is a list of the Google search strings I entered and the resulting URLs:
