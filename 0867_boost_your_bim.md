### Boost Your BIM and Dance with an Elephant

Advent, advent!
Yet another Revit API focused blog is born!

Harry Mattison, ex Revit API development team, has initiated
[Boost Your BIM](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) and
kicked it off with a series on using the built-in
[SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx) development
environment Revit macros to resolve duplicate tags:

1. [Finding elements](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/resolving-duplicate-tags-step-1-finding-elements)- [Finding only family instances](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/resolving-duplicate-tags-step-2)- [Get & set parameter values](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/resolving-duplicate-tags-step-3-get-set-parameter-values)- [Transactions and wrapping up](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/resolving-duplicate-tags-step-4-transactions-and-wrapping-up)

Thank you, Harry, and the best of luck to you and your new blog!

#### Dances with Elephants

Also, for a more high-level strategic vision of things, don't forget to take a look now and then at Jim Quanci's
[Dances with Elephants](http://dances-with-elephants.typepad.com).

Jim analyses how small companies can leverage big ones to help build their business, useful tactics eminently applicable to many Revit add-in developers.

He recently posted a number of exciting new essays, so I encourage you to go take a
[gander](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_a_gander).
