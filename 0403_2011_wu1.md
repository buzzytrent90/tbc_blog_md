### Revit 2011 Web Update 1

Rather belatedly, I note that the first web update of Revit 2011 was released in the beginning of this month and can be downloaded from the public Revit product pages:

- [Revit Architecture](http://www.autodesk.com/revitarchitecture) > [Product Download](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=9262001)
- [Revit MEP](http://www.autodesk.com/revitmep) > [Product Download](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=14973660)
- [Revit Structure](http://www.autodesk.com/revitstructure) > [Product Download](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=9262026)

Here is the list of the API enhancements, which is the same across all three flavours:

- Elements will now be properly joined when the ExternalCommand concludes when using automatic regeneration and automatic transaction.- ExportImage(ImageExportOptions) no longer throws an exception when given a set of views.- ElementParameterFilters now operate properly against ElementType elements.- Improves stability when saving a family and there are event subscribers for Save or Save As.- Closes the Family editor environment after loading a family via the API.- Improves stability when using selection APIs to pick grid elements.- Dynamic Model Update: GetChangeTypeGeometry() now triggers properly when active type is changed.- Improves stability for Dynamic Model Update: when registering updaters and more than one application is registered.- The new API SunAndShadowSettings.CalculateTimeZone() uses Revits mechanism to calculate the time zone value for a given latitude and longitude. This calculation is more accurate than the results obtained from City.TimeZone.- Improves performance of display of Analysis Visualization framework when Hardware Acceleration is on.- VSTA is now allowed for multiple concurrent sessions of Revit; editing the same module by two sessions is prohibited.- VSTA: Document-level macros no longer become corrupted when the document is workshared and the macro is edited by more than one concurrent session.- Improves stability when calls to NewFamilyDocument() and PickObjects() are used in sequence.- VSTA: Revit no longer prematurely exits when opening a project containing corrupted macros.- The Idling event no longer generates a journal comment for each invocation.
