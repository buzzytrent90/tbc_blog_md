### Revit 2015 Update Release 3

[Revit 2015 Update Release 3](http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-revit-2015-update-release-3.html) has
been published.

It includes a large number of important new enhancements, as well as the improvements provided by the update releases 1 and 2.

I count the following numbers of bullet items in the
[release notes](http://revit.downloads.autodesk.com/download/2015RVT_RTM/UR3/Enhancements_List_RVT_2015_UR3.pdf):

- Architecture: 45
- MEP: 18
- Structure 7
- API: 9

Here is the full list of Revit API enhancements:

- Improves retention of device connections when using Wire.Create to create new wire connecting to a device.
- Improves display of wire connection points when using Wire.ConnectTo and Connector.Connect.
- Enable changes to MEPSystemType.CalculationLevel via public API.
- Level parameter correctly set when elements are placed via NewFamilyInstance().
- Improves retention of parameters in line boundary condition objects.
- Improves stability when using CompoundStructure.SetLayers.
- Allows proper assignment of a Phase Created value when using DirectShapes.
- Improves alignment of text created via API.
- Improves stability when the API is in Automatic TransactionMode.

The second to last item, especially, is one that many developers encountered and reported, e.g. like this:

#### NewTextNote Text Wrapping

**Question:** When I call the NewTextNote method to create a new text note in Revit 2015, it does not fill the text box, but wraps the text around the middle of the text box.

Here is a simple code example:

```csharp
  XYZ origin = XYZ.Zero;
  XYZ baseVec = XYZ.BasisX;
  XYZ upVec = XYZ.BasisY;

  Transaction trans = new Transaction( doc );
  trans.Start( "Create text" );

  TextNote note = doc.Create.NewTextNote(
    view, origin, baseVec, upVec, 0.3,
    TextAlignFlags.TEF\_ALIGN\_BOTTOM | TextAlignFlags.TEF\_ALIGN\_LEFT,
    "Why is this line too long for the text box!" );

  //doc.Regenerate();
  //note.Width = 25;

  trans.Commit();
```

This worked fine in Revit 2014, just as it should, but in Revit 2015 it fails.

I tried to regenerate and set the width after the note creation, but it does not help.

If you click on such a text note manually it fixes.
