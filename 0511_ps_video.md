### 84 Second Product Support Overview

As you know, I work in the AEC workgroup of the ADN or
[Autodesk Developer Network](http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn) DevTech
organisation, providing support to developers making use of Autodesk products and their application programming interfaces (APIs).
ADN is part of the Autodesk support organisation.
Another, much larger part of the support organisation is the product support team, which resolves end user issues.

For a really quick overview of the E-Services provided by Autodesk Product Support, you can have a look at this new
[84 second YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylj0o-R_Zn0) by
Roberto Sigona, Vice President of Autodesk Product Support.

Roberto speaks about available options for self-help technical support including Autodesk knowledgebase, blogs and community forums.
