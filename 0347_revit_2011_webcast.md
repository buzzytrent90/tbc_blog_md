### Revit 2011 API Webcast

Here is a last-minute reminder to register for the Revit 2011 API webcast that we are holding on Wednesday April 21st, in eleven hour's time.
To register, you can visit the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) DevTech API
[training schedule site](http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php),
filter for 'Revit 2011 New APIs', and click on the
[register](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=10417086&siteID=123112&cname=Revit 2011 New APIs, Webcast, Apr 21 2010, 201020) link.
This webcast is open to all developers, regardless of ADN membership.

Sorry for the late notice, I was too caught up in the discussion on the
[regeneration option](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/manual-regeneration-mode-danger.html) yesterday,
or I would have posted this reminder a bit earlier.
More on the regeneration option anon...
