### Khan Academy

Kean came up with another
[brilliant item](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/ted-education-and-matrix-mathematics.html) that
I cannot resist highlighting here as well, even if only to ensure that I myself don't lose track of this link to the non-profit
[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) myself.
It has the motto "Watch. Practice. Learn almost anything – for free" and consists of a small team on a mission to deliver a world-class education to anyone anywhere.
Topics include areas of interest for Revit API users such as
[algebra](http://www.khanacademy.org/#Algebra),
[geometry](http://www.khanacademy.org/#Geometry),
[trigonometry](http://www.khanacademy.org/#Trigonometry) and
[linear algebra](http://www.khanacademy.org/#Linear%20Algebra),
but it doesn't stop there, by any means...

#### Friday in Jeddah

So far, my stay here in Jeddah has not been particularly enthralling.
Friday is the most important day of prayer, the
[holiest day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia#Culture) of
the week, so all the shops and virtually everything else as well was closed all day today.
I went for a huge walk around town anyway and did by chance happen upon the
[fish market](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/sights/market/fish-market) followed
by a walk through the old town in Al-Balad and As Sabil.
The long route back happened to lead me to a very good late lunch at the Turkish restaurant
[Y1ld1zlar](http://www.jeddahfood.com/?p=87) (stars)
[[2](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/restaurants/lebanese/yildizlar)].
Sadly, I was unable to find any nice park or
[beach](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/sights/beach/beaches) to
sit down on, so I returned to the hotel and a swim in the pool, dead beat.
I passed the evening in the very pleasant company of my hosts Ammar and Yassin of
[Digital perspective Co., Ltd.](http://www.d-perspective.com)
and had an even better meal in
[Cuisine Halwani](http://www.sufrati.com/saudi-arabian-dining/restaurant/saudi/cuisine-halawani) on
Tahlia Street highlighting a totally delicious
[fatet makdous](http://islamic-cookingclub.blogspot.com/2009/09/fatet-makdous-with-tomatesauce.html) or
[A\*) EC/H3](http://islamic-cookingclub.blogspot.com/2009/09/fatet-makdous-with-tomatesauce.html).
They confirm that there is not much to do here except eat and shop...
And prepare Revit API training material, happily...
