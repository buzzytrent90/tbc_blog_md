### Revit 2014 Developer Guide PDF

Happy Sunday!

Extra, extra, breaking news!

As I just mentioned a few days back, the Revit API
[developer guide is back on WikiHelp](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/the-developer-guide-is-back-on-wikihelp.html) again.

Still, as we recently discussed here and in the Revit API discussion forum, a
[PDF version of the developer guide](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/10/revit-2013-api-developer-guide-pdf.html#2) can
also come in very handy now and then, e.g. for offline perusal.

Ian alias Keldar67 now repeated his heroic Revit 2013 feat and presents the
[Revit 2014 API developer guide in PDF format](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Revit-2014-Platform-Developer-Guidlines-in-PDF-Format/td-p/4629067).

Please take a look at his magnificent 450-page achievement, adhere to his request to take the 'gift shop route' and give him kudos for his good work.

Thank you, Ian, and thank you, fellow Revit API developers.
