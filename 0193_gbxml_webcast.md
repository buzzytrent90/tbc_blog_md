### Free gbXML Webcast

We already mentioned the
[Green Building XML Schema](http://www.gbxml.org)
or gbXML and how to
[export certain family instances](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/export-family-instance-to-gbxml.html)
to it.

The gbXML Advisory Board is hosting a free webcast titled 'Using Green Building XML (gbXML) for Sustainable Building Design' on Wednesday, August 12, 2009 at 10:00 to 11:00 am PST.
