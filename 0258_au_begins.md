### AU Begins

I left the desert and the climbing in Red Rock and entered the air conditioned world of conference land.
My first task Monday morning was the one I found most challenging, the recording session for my virtual class on the Revit Family API,

- [**CP9118-1** The New Autodesk Revit Family API: Everything is Relative](https://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=5265&jid=323682)

It was definitely an interesting experience, with an assistant fussing around to set things up and then sitting in a completely darkened room with several technicians managing the recording equipment, in a sphere of blinding lights directed at me and almost total blackness all around...

It went very well, in any case, and I was able to relax for the ADN conference during the rest of the day, although it did mean that I unfortunately missed the morning sessions of that.

The first broadcast of the Revit Family API is scheduled for this afternoon in just a couple of hour's time.
I will be available online to chat and answer questions live in the question and answer session being held in parallel with the broadcast.

A second broadcast is scheduled for tomorrow evening.
I would love to chat with you and answer your questions during either one of these two broadcast sessions.

For a live meeting, one place that I will certainly be is the classroom session I am presenting on the Revit MEP API,

- [**CP308-2** All Systems Go in the New Autodesk Revit MEP API](http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=5269)

Another good place to meet me here at the conference is the AU booth. I will pass by there regularly and definitely be spending time there on Wednesday around 12:30 and 19:30.

#### Sunday before the Storm

The last hours before the conference I spent enjoying a nice, peaceful, sunny Sunday walking, reading and climbing a little bit in Red Rock, once again in the Black Corridor.
I had one quick climb on a top rope with Chris and Daniela on Burros Don't Gamble 5.10c, and two climbs with Hannah and Jason, semi leading with the quickdraws already placed, on Vagabonds 5.10a and Burros Might Fly 5.10b.

Jess very friendlily sent me some photos from our climbs together on Friday:

Here I am in the beginning of a route that was too hard for me and I was unable to complete.
But I was able to get down again safely the same way I went up:

And finally, here we are having a beer together after the successful day, Karl, Gary, Fritz, Ellis, and Jess, the crazy guys from Dallas, Texas, and me at the end, maybe a bit crazy as well:
