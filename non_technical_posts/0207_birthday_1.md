### Happy Building Coder Birthday!

The
[first Building Coder post](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/welcome.html)
was published one year ago, on August 22nd 2008.
We celebrated an intermediate birthday with the
[hundredth post](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/utilizing-revit-api-resources.html)
in February 2009.
Today is the first real annual birthday and The Building Coder has now reached the ripe old age of one.

I am celebrating with a nice cup of
[cappuccino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino).
I actually add a drop of cream to mine.
To further celebrate, I will say no more after 207 posts so far.
