### New York Travel Preparation and ADN Job Opening

Friday – travel to New York to spend the weekend at the
[AEC Symposium and Hackathon](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/aec-hackathon-in-new-york-and-new-developer-guide-url.html).

Before leaving, I revelled briefly in nature, celebrating a couple of hours of moderate weather after the cold and wet spell lately, before spending the entire following weekend indoors staring at computer screens in Big Apple:

I celebrated the full moon on Wednesday evening with a nice fire on a nearby hill with a grand view:

I arrived safely in New York and just heard about a job opening – we are seeking a new colleague to join the Autodesk Developer Network ADN DevTech team:

#### ADN API Evangelist Job Opening in San Francisco

Autodesk is hiring an API evangelist!
Are you a software engineer and enthusiastic about new technologies, enjoy interacting with others, sharing your enthusiasm, and love to evangelize code?

If so, go ahead and apply for this
[ADN API evangelist job opening](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/13975557) in San Francisco.

The position would suit someone straight out of school or with a couple of years’ experience.
You need the usual DevTech attributes – intelligent, fast learner, good problem solver, good communicator, etc.
Good luck!

I am looking forward to either hearing from you via that route, or meeting you in person at the Hackathon in New York!
