### Queen's Birthday Fireworks in Pattaya

After an afternoon and a night on boats and buses, I arrived at my brother Marcus' place in
[Pattaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattaya).
We had a nice breakfast on the beach and discovered by chance that the Queen's birthday was being celebrated with a fireworks competition on the same beach in the evening

What a lucky coincidence!
We went and had a look together with tens of thousands (or hundreds of thousands?) of other people.
It was very pleasant, with the sand and the water and palm trees, and very impressive as well:

Another interesting aspect of life here is riding a motorbike around through the dense traffic of this interminable city...
