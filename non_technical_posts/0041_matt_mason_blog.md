### Another Revit API Blog

My friend Monika just pointed out Matt Mason's
[blog](http://cadappdev.blogspot.com)
to me, mainly due to his nice
[praise](http://cadappdev.blogspot.com/2008/11/jeremy-tammik-is-machine.html)
for The Building Coder. Thank you, Matt!
And thanks to Monika for pointing it out.

Matt covers a variety of CAD application development topics, with the main focus on Revit, judging from the current tags:

- AutoCAD 1
- Autodesk 2
- DotNet 2
- DWF 2
- Events 4
- Google Earth 1
- Intent 1
- Inventor 4
- Revit 32
- Vault 1

He is Director of Software Development at Avatech Solutions and will be presenting a class on
[Advanced Revit API](http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/3020)
at
[Autodesk University](http://au.autodesk.com).

I'm looking forward to seeing you there soon, both you Matt and you dear reader!
