### Revit 2012 WikiHelp Overview

Here is a product related news item, although obviously of interest to developers as well.

Revit product help has been
[available on the web](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html) for
a while now, which provides a number of
[benefits](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html).

Some
[online Revit API help](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-api-help.html ) is
also available, although the full Revit SDK documentation is not there yet.

Now the product help system has taken the next step by moving to a
[wiki-based system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) which provides support for a full community learning experience.

Here is a
[Revit 2012 WikiHelp overview](zip/Revit 2012 WikiHelp Overview.pptx) which
includes a summary of WikiHelp features and benefits, highlights key features and lists the benefits of this new community platform.
