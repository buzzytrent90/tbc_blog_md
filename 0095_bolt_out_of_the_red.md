### Bolt out of the Red

Here is a short note to point out that Guy Robinson has posted some interesting Revit API solutions on his blog
[Bolt out of the Red](http://redbolts.com/blog).
One that I found especially useful is on how to get a
[bitmap or thumbnail from a Revit project or family](http://redbolts.com/blog/post/2008/12/01/Getting-your-Revit-thumbnails.aspx).
Now he started a series on
[saving user specific configuration data](http://redbolts.com/blog/post/2009/02/10/Static-in-your-commands-User-settings-part-1.aspx)
for Revit commands using standard .NET functionality from the System.Configuration namespace, which has a number of pitfalls and requires some understanding of how Revit add-ins are loaded into the Revit AppDomain etc.
