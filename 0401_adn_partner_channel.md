### YouTube ADN Partner Channel

As Kean Walmsley pointed out, a new
[YouTube ADN Partner Channel](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/06/adn-partner-channel-on-youtube.html) has
been created to showcase solutions created by ADN partners.

ADN Members can upload videos to it, and Autodesk customers can view it to get an impression of the breadth of available add-on products.

ADN is an acronym for the
[Autodesk Developer Network](http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn),
whose members make use of Autodesk products and their application programming interfaces (APIs) and receive support from the DevTech team that I work in.
