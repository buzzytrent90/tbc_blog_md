### The 360 View

There is a new kid on the block!

[The 360 View](http://the360view.typepad.com)
is a blog providing technical resources about BIM 360 product families, including Glue and Field, including API coverage, by
[Manu Venugopal](http://the360view.typepad.com/blog/manu-venugopal.html),
Integration Expert in Autodesk Consulting and our ADN API liaison to the BIM 360 Glue product team.

Manu and
[Mikako Harada](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/mikako-harada.html),
ADN AEC technical lead, worked together closely on the BIM 360 Glue API.
Manu is the behind the scenes 'brain' for ADN support in this area and helped a lot preparing the last two Developer Days presentations about BIM 360.

As Mikako already
[pointed out](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/10/bim-360-glue-api-pilot-and-updated-samples.html),
the Glue API is still in a pilot stage and the number of people who can actually use it is currently very limited.
We are actively discussing ways to expand the audience and I hope you will find
[The 360 View](http://the360view.typepad.com) a
good source to learn about and keep eyes on the progress of BIM 360.
