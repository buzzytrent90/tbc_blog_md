### RVT Properties to XLS and Forge Accelerators
Are you interested in easy access to your Revit model properties?
Well, you can have that, and you can even do so without a need to install Revit.
The Forge [Model Derivative API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/) extracts
a streamlined copy of all geometry, BIM element hierarchy and properties from over fifty file formats, and Revit RVT files are just one of them.
[Augusto Goncalves](https://twitter.com/search?q=augusto%20goncalves) implemented
the `viewer-javascript-extract.spreadsheet` Forge sample to read all the properties on all BIM elements in an RVT file and export them to an XLSX spreadsheet.
- [Test run it yourself](https://autodesk-forge.github.io/viewer-javascript-extract.spreadsheet)
- [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/viewer-javascript-extract.spreadsheet)
- [Blog post announcement](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/create-spreadsheet-excel-client-translated-revit-files)
That's pretty neat, I think.
Many thanks to Augusto for putting that together.
If you would like to learn more about Forge, don't miss the chance to join the next European Forge accelerator:
#### Upcoming Forge Accelerators
We have two [Forge accelerators](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/) coming up in Europe
in the [next couple of months](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/prague-2/):
- Gothenburg, Sweden – March 27-30
- Barcelona, Spain – June 12-16

I am planning on attending both of these and would love to see you there too.
In fact, the complete EMEA DevTech Team will be present to support you over the course of the week.
They take place in the Autodesk offices with lots of space and cool recreation areas.
Attendance is free of charge – all you pay for is your travel, accommodation and living expenses.
You can still apply to participate in either of these two events by sending your Forge App development project ideas to [adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com](mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com).
More information is available at [autodeskcloudaccelerator.com](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com).
Check out the videos on the landing page to hear what great results the attendees at previous accelerators achieved after just one week of intensive teamwork and training.
Please note that space is limited to two persons per company.
